    "content": "I recently went through the full onsite loop at Microsoft for a Senior Software Engineer role and wanted to share the details. The process was a direct onsite invitation with no initial phone screen. While I ultimately declined the offer, it was a solid technical experience.\n\n---\n\n### Round 1: Data Structures & Algorithms (1 Hour)\n\nThis round was a pure, focused DSA session with two problems.\n\n* **Question 1 (Minimize Max Difference):** Given three sorted integer arrays A, B, and C, find one element from each array (x, y, z) such that the value `max(abs(x-y), abs(y-z), abs(z-x))` is minimized.\n    * **My Take:** A great problem that can be solved efficiently using a three-pointer approach. By advancing the pointer corresponding to the minimum element at each step, you can traverse the arrays in linear time to find the optimal triplet.\n\n* **Question 2 (Lowest Common Ancestor):** Given an N-ary tree and two nodes within it, find their lowest common ancestor.\n    * **My Take:** A standard but important tree traversal problem. I discussed the approach of finding the paths from the root to each node and then identifying the last common node in those paths.\n\nThe interviewer probed on various edge cases and asked for dry runs of the logic. I felt confident in my solutions, and the interviewer seemed satisfied.\n\n---\n\n### Round 2: DSA & Project Discussion (1 Hour)\n\nThis was a hybrid round. It started with a DSA question (which I unfortunately forgot to note down) and then transitioned into a discussion about some of my past projects, focusing on technical challenges and architectural decisions.\n\n---\n\n### Round 3: Low-Level Design & Concurrency (1 Hour)\n\nThis was a challenging and practical system design round focused on concurrency control.\n\n* **The Problem:** Imagine a distributed system with `Z` clients, `Y` application servers, and `X` storage servers. Each storage server can only handle a maximum of `N` concurrent connections. The task was to design the connection handling and throttling logic *on the application servers* to respect this limit globally.\n\n* **My Approach & The Deep Dive:**\n    1.  **Initial Proposal (Distributed Semaphore):** I started by proposing a classic solution: a distributed semaphore implemented using Redis. Each time an app server needs a connection to a specific storage server, it would try to decrement a counter for that server in Redis. If successful, it proceeds; otherwise, it waits or fails.\n\n    2.  **The Latency Problem:** The interviewer immediately challenged this on latency. A network call to Redis for *every single connection attempt* would be far too slow and would become a bottleneck itself. This was the core of the problem.\n\n    3.  **The Refined Solution (Local Token Pool with Batching):** To solve the latency issue, I refined the approach to a **local token pool**.\n        * **Logic:** Instead of asking for one \"token\" at a time, each app server would ask Redis for a *batch* of tokens (e.g., 5). It would then store these tokens in a local, thread-safe queue.\n        * **Request Flow:** When a request needs a storage connection, the app server first tries to dequeue a token from its fast, local pool. This requires no network call. Only when its local pool is empty does it make a single network call to Redis to refill its batch of tokens.\n        * **Benefits:** This amortizes the cost of the network call across many requests, drastically reducing latency and the load on Redis.\n\n    4.  **Further Discussion:** We also discussed related concepts like using appropriate TTLs on Redis keys to handle app server crashes and return lost tokens to the pool, and managing local thread pools waiting for tokens.\n\nThe interviewer seemed satisfied with the local token pool solution and asked me to write a high-level code implementation for this logic. Overall, a very strong round.\n\n---\n\n### Round 4: Hiring Manager (1 Hour)\n\nThis round was less about past projects and more of a practical, open-ended problem, framed as a live-site incident.\n\n* **The Scenario:** \"Your service is a critical background job processor deployed globally. Your monitoring tools show memory usage is climbing and has breached 90% across the fleet. You predict widespread Out-Of-Memory (OOM) exceptions within days if nothing is done. **What do you do?**\"\n\n* **My Breakdown of the Solution:** I structured my answer into immediate, mid-term, and long-term actions.\n    1.  **Immediate Mitigation (Stop the Bleeding):**\n        * **Containment:** The first priority is to prevent service failure. I would immediately initiate a rolling restart of the fleet to temporarily reclaim memory.\n        * **Load Reduction:** Scale up the service horizontally by adding more instances to distribute the memory pressure per instance.\n        * **Data Collection:** Enable verbose logging and memory profiling on a *single canary instance* to start gathering data without impacting the entire production environment.\n\n    2.  **Root Cause Analysis (RCA):**\n        * **Correlation:** I would analyze monitoring dashboards to correlate the memory increase with other metrics. Is it tied to a recent deployment? A specific type of job being submitted? A particular region?\n        * **Heap Dump Analysis:** The most crucial step. I would trigger and analyze a heap dump from the affected canary instance. This would show exactly which objects are accumulating and not being garbage collected, pointing directly to a potential memory leak in the code (e.g., an un-evicted cache, unclosed resources, a bug in a library).\n        * **Code & Change Review:** Scrutinize recent commits and configuration changes that line up with the start of the memory increase.\n\n    3.  **Long-Term Fix & Prevention:**\n        * Once the RCA points to the bug, deploy a code fix.\n        * More importantly, harden the service by adding memory limits per job, improving cache eviction policies, and integrating automated memory leak detection into the CI/CD pipeline to prevent recurrence.\n\n**Overall:** The interview went reasonably well, but I had a feeling the HM was looking for more depth in a couple of areas that I couldn't quite pinpoint.\n\n---\n\n### The Result & Final Thoughts\n\nThe verdict was a **\"select\" for the L63 Senior SWE role**.\n\nI was aiming for L64, but the recruiter mentioned that Microsoft has a very strict bar for that level, typically requiring 8+ years of experience, and I was just under that threshold.\n\nUltimately, the verbal compensation offered was not competitive with another offer I held, so I respectfully declined to move forward. Despite this, the process was a valuable and technically solid experience.",

    "content": "I recently completed the interview process with Databricks and wanted to share my experience. While I ultimately decided not to move forward due to a leveling mismatch, it was genuinely one of the most professional, challenging, and well-structured interview loops I've been through. Here’s a breakdown for anyone preparing.\n\n---\n\n### Round 1: The Technical Phone Screen (1 Hour - Elimination)\n\nThis was a single, in-depth DSA problem focused on practical application.\n\n* **Question (IP Firewall Implementation):** Implement a firewall that takes a list of \"ALLOW\" or \"DENY\" rules with IP/CIDR blocks (e.g., \"192.168.100.0/24\") and determines if a given IP address should be permitted.\n* **My Take:** This was a nice problem that required careful string parsing and bit manipulation to convert IP addresses and CIDR notations into a comparable format (like 32-bit integers and masks). The core of the solution was iterating through the rules and performing bitwise checks to see if an IP falls within a rule's range. The interviewer was satisfied with the solution, and I received positive feedback to proceed.\n\n---\n\n### Round 2: Onsite DSA I  (1 Hour)\n\nThe first onsite round presented a complex, custom data structure problem.\n\n* **Question:** You are given a `ref_string` and a `src_string`. The `src_string` is represented as a \"cover\"—a list of index pairs pointing to substrings within the `ref_string`. The task was to implement a `delete(cover, index)` function that removes a character at a logical index from the `src_string` and returns a new, valid cover.\n* **Follow-up (Maximal Cover):** The problem was extended with the concept of a \"maximal\" cover, where no two adjacent blocks in the cover could be merged to form a valid substring that still exists in the `ref_string`. The task was to ensure the `delete` function now returned a maximal cover.\n* **My Take:** The initial problem was manageable, but I stumbled a bit on the follow-up. Maintaining the \"maximal\" property while splitting and potentially re-merging blocks after a deletion was tricky. I discussed the approach but wasn't fully confident in it. The recruiter later informed me that some minor flags were raised here, which was fair feedback.\n\n---\n\n### Round 3: Onsite DSA II (1 Hour)\n\nKnowing I had to perform well here, I was focused and ready.\n\n* **Question (Multi-modal Pathfinding):** Given a 2D grid with transportation modes (Walk, Bike, Car, Train), costs, and times for each mode, find the fastest path from 'S' to 'D' using only one mode of transport. If times are tied, choose the cheapest path.\n* **Follow-up:** How would your solution change if you could switch transportation modes at any point, but each switch incurred a fixed time penalty?\n* **My Take:** The base problem was a classic graph traversal, perfect for running Dijkstra's algorithm (or BFS if costs are uniform) four times, once for each mode. The follow-up elevates the problem significantly, requiring a more complex state in the priority queue, like `(time, cost, row, col, current_mode)`, to correctly explore paths and account for the switching penalty. I solved both optimally and felt the concerns from the previous round were now resolved.\n\n---\n\n### Round 4: LLD & Concurrency Deep Dive (1 Hour)\n\nThis was an intense and highly practical round focused on low-level design and concurrency.\n\n* **The Challenge:** Design and implement a thread-safe `EventWriter` class. Multiple threads would call `appendEvent()` to write small data buffers to a single file. The key constraints were: high throughput, low latency, and **durability** (the function must only return after the data is confirmed to be on disk).\n\n* **The Deep Dive & My Solution:** This was a grilling session where a full C++ implementation was expected. My approach evolved as we discussed trade-offs:\n    1.  **The Naive Solution (and why it's bad):** A simple approach is a single mutex locking the entire `appendEvent` function, which calls `write()` followed by `fsync()` for every event. I explained this would have terrible throughput due to high lock contention and the massive overhead of calling `fsync` for every small write.\n    2.  **Introducing the Producer-Consumer Pattern:** To decouple event submission from disk I/O, I proposed a classic producer-consumer model. The application threads (`producers`) add events to a thread-safe in-memory buffer (e.g., a locked queue). A single, dedicated background thread (`consumer`) is responsible for writing to the file.\n    3.  **Batching for Throughput:** The consumer thread shouldn't write one event at a time. I implemented logic for it to drain the queue and group multiple events into a single, larger buffer. This batch is then written to disk in one `write()` call, followed by a single `fsync()`. This drastically improves throughput by amortizing the expensive system calls.\n    4.  **Solving for Durability & Latency:** This was the crux. The `appendEvent` call needs to block until its specific event is durable. To solve this, I used `std::promise` and `std::future`. When a producer thread submits an event, it also creates a `promise` and passes the corresponding `future` back to the caller (or waits on it internally). The consumer thread, after successfully calling `fsync()` on a batch, iterates through the events in that batch and fulfills their associated promises. This unblocks the waiting producer threads, guaranteeing durability before they return.\n\nThe discussion covered mutexes, condition variables, batching strategies, thread pools, and the critical role of `fsync`. The interviewer was satisfied with the robust and layered solution.\n\n---\n\n### Round 5: The Hiring Manager & Collaboration Round (1 Hour)\n\nThis was one of the best HM conversations I've ever had. It was a masterclass in behavioral interviewing.\n\n* **The Flow:** The HM was technically sharp and a genuinely engaged listener. The conversation started with a simple prompt: \"Tell me about a recent project you found impactful.\" From there, every subsequent question was an organic follow-up that dug deeper into that single project's context:\n    * **Challenges:** \"What were the biggest technical and non-technical challenges you faced?\"\n    * **Conflict Resolution:** \"Were there disagreements on the technical direction? How did you handle them?\"\n    * **Mentorship:** \"What role did you play in mentoring others on the team during this project?\"\n    * **Leadership:** \"Describe an instance where you had to lead without formal authority to get something done.\"\n\nThis format tests for consistency and depth far better than scattered, unrelated questions. The round concluded with an excellent, transparent overview of the team's work and vision.\n\n---\n\n### The Result & My Decision\n\nI was thrilled to receive an offer for a **Level 4 Software Engineer** position. The compensation was very strong and was competitive with an L5 offer I held from another company.\n\nHowever, Databricks has a general policy of not increasing levels for lateral hires, and my goal was to secure an L5 role. Due to this leveling expectation mismatch, I respectfully decided not to move forward.\n\nDespite my decision, I can't speak highly enough of the process. It was rigorous, fair, and a true test of a senior engineer's skills.\n",

This post is a small way of giving back — especially for those currently in the pipeline or preparing for the SDE-1 role at Amazon.\n\nI’ll be sharing my complete interview experience — from start to finish.\n\n---\n\n### **Profile Snapshot**\n\n* **Experience:** 1.5 years\n* **Previous Company:** Mobility-based well-known startup\n* **Position Offered:** SDE-1\n* **Total Duration:** \\~4 months\n* **Rounds:** All were eliminatory\n\n---\n\n### **1. Online Assessment (OA)**\n\nI don’t remember the exact questions, but both required either a dynamic programming or mathematical approach. I solved them analytically using math.\nNote: It took almost **30 days** post-assessment to receive the next update.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Technical Round 1**\n\n#### **Q1. Binary Tree Validation**\n\nGiven a list of TreeNode objects (`val`, `left`, `right`), determine whether they form a valid binary tree.\nExample:\n`[TN(1, 2, 3), TN(2, None, None), TN(3, None, None)] → True`\n\n🔹 It seems simple, but it’s a very elegant question.\n🔹 I started from scratch — defining classes, clean variable names, modular functions, and explained everything as I went.\n\n#### **Q2. Drone Delivery Route**\n\nProblem described an array representing drone positions. I was asked to model an efficient delivery tracking logic.\n\n🔹 Solved it within 8 minutes.\n🔹 Explained my full thought process clearly — intuition first, code next.\n🔹 By this point, the interviewers seemed very satisfied.\n\n#### **Leadership Principles (LP):**\n\n* A time when you went through fast-paced learning.\n* How would you approach learning a new language/framework used in the company?\n\n---\n\n### **3. Technical + LP + Design Round**\n\n#### **Leadership Principles:**\n\n1. A time when you did more than what was required, anticipating customer needs.\n2. The most technically challenging task you’ve worked on.\n\n#### **System Design:**\n\n**Design a flexible music playlist system** — create and manage playlists, handle song playback, etc.\nI began by discussing everything I was thinking out loud and explaining each step of implementation. However, I sensed that the interviewer wasn’t very engaged. Still, I stayed calm and continued articulating my thoughts clearly.\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n> *\"Try to align better with the interviewer’s expectations, but DSA, design thinking, and code quality were strong.\"*\n\n---\n\n### **4. Bar Raiser Round**\n\nThe interviewer had 8+ years of experience.\n\n🔹 Started with mutual introductions.\n🔹 Asked about my past projects — I discussed two in depth.\n🔹 Questions on architecture, tech stack choices, and alternative tools.\n\nEventually, he compared my stack with unfamiliar ones. I was honest and said:\n\n> *\"I’ve explored limited tools so far due to time constraints, but what I used worked well for my project needs with zero production issues. I’m always open to learning more.\"*\n\nMy responses were **clear, confident, and honest**, especially around topics I truly understood — and I didn’t bluff where I wasn’t 100% confident.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Outcome 🎉**\n\nAfter 7 days, the recruiter called:\n\n> *“You got very good response from HM and also other candidates were in the list, so we are going with you first, please let us know  . We’d like to move forward with your offer.”*\n\nOf course, I said YES!\n\n---\n\n### **A Few Notes for Aspirants:**\n\n* **Be patient** — the process takes time (it was 4 months for me).\n* **Follow up** — If there's delay, don’t hesitate to reply to the interview invite email or recruiter contact.\n* **Clarity over fluff** — Speak only what you’re sure of. Depth matters more than breadth.\n* **Prep leadership principles** as much as DSA and LLD/System Design.\n* **Interviewer’s engagement** might vary — keep your calm and keep delivering quality.\n\n---\n\nHappy to answer if you’re preparing for Amazon or similar interviews.\nFeel free to DM or drop questions in the comments 🙌\n\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Leetcoders, I am posting my interview experience with LinkedIn India for the Staff Software Engineer role. For the Staff role, they have total of 6 rounds: 1 Screening and 5 online rounds\r\n\r\nHere is the breakdown of all the rounds:\r\n\r\n**Round 1: Screening**\r\n\r\nIn this round, Firstly, I was asked to give my detailed career intro along with leadership/project related questions:\r\n\r\n1. Conflicting situations faced in any critical project\r\n2. Impactful project from which I was able to move out to other project with minimal disruption\r\n\r\nFew follow-ups were there and this discussion lasted for around 20 mins\r\n\r\nThen, I got a LC Hard DSA question : https://leetcode.com/problems/max-stack/\r\nI discussed 2-3 most optimal approaches and the interviewer agreed on one of the approaches to code it for all the helper methods along with discussion on Space and Time Complexity. Also, I was asked to dry run on a pre-written TC.\r\n\r\nRating : Strong Hire\r\n\r\n**Round 2: DSA 1: Staff Coding - Apps**\r\n\r\nQ1: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring\r\nThe problem was extended to a condition when the source string is wrapped around.\r\n\r\nQ2: Shortest path between LinkedIn connections. An adjacency list is given, a source and a target. Find the connection distance between source and target. Print the path as well.\r\nI discussed the optimal solution : Bi-directional BFS and coded for the same.\r\n\r\nRating : Strong Hire\r\n\r\n\r\n**Round 3: DSA 2: Staff Coding & Algorithms 2**\r\n\r\nQ1: https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder\r\nI gave the most optimized O(M*N) approach inspired by the below link:\r\nhttps://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder/submissions/1595132398\r\n\r\nQ2: https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-word-distance-ii\r\nGave the optimal 2-pointer approach.\r\nExtension: For the scenario if one string's occurences are less than other, used binary search for the more frequent string.\r\n\r\nRating : Strong Hire\r\n\r\n**Round 4: System Design**\r\n\r\nInitially, this round started with project and leadership based questions. Don't remember the exact questions, Apologies.\r\nNext, the interviewer covered the most complex project I recently led and covered about the security aspects and challenges faced. There were multiple follow-ups to understand my roles and responsibilities working as a tech lead.\r\n\r\nNext, I was given the below system design problem:\r\n\r\nDesign a flexible in-memory cache with customizable capacity and eviction policies.\r\n\r\nThe cache should allow users to define:\r\n  1.  Capacity: Specify how much data the cache can hold based on memory resources and data size.\r\n  2.  Eviction Policy: Choose strategies for removing items when the cache is full, such as Least Recently Used (LRU) or Lowest Priority.\r\n\r\nThis flexibility ensures the cache can be tailored to meet specific requirements, balancing resource usage and performance.\r\n\r\nOnce the LLD created was agreed with the interviewer, it was extended from HLD perspective for multiple nodes in distributed system setup covering all the challenges and other adhoc scenarios like hot key issue for a write-heavy setup. Also, discussion went around few Redis related internals.\r\n\r\nRating : Hire\r\n\r\n**Round 5: Craftsmanship**\r\n\r\nThis is mostly a behavioral based round for Staff role. It covered 8-10 scenario questions with internal follow ups. Questions were as follows:\r\n\r\n-> How do you define a quality product/system?\r\n-> Describe your strategy regarding code reviews\r\n-> Talk about a project that had many junior engineers and how I kept the project quality high/ If your team keeps growing and you get more junior engineers, what do you do?\r\n-> As a hypothetical situation, Imagine you join LinkedIn on a massive team that owns a legacy application. The application lacks adequate testing and monitoring and has slow response times. Consumers complain about this. Deployment of the application often contains bugs. What efforts would you do as a Staff SWE?\r\n-> Rank the following in terms of priority: bugs, no testing, no monitoring, slowness. What do you tackle first? How do you eventually turn this into micro services?\r\n-> What do you look for when determining the success of a service?\r\n-> What are your principles of mentorship? How do you manage technical and non-technical mentorship?\r\n-> Talk about a time where you helped grow engineers\r\n-> Few questions which were aligning with the LinkedIn values. Don't remember the exact questions.\r\nNote: Please be well-versed about Linkedin values.\r\n\r\nRating : Strong Hire\r\n\r\n**Round 6: Host Manager**\r\n\r\nThis round started with an elaborate introduction of both me and the interviewer.\r\n\r\nQuestions were as follows:\r\n1. Talk in detail about the most complex and challenging project I led in the recent times which had a very large scale. I framed my answer step-by-step as follows (along with few follow-ups from the HM):\r\n-> Team and My role\r\n-> Customer Problem & Business impact\r\n-> Key architectural decisions led/taken by me\r\n-> Biggest challenges faced and how did I overcome\r\n-> How did I maintain timely execution of the project\r\n-> Changes in reqs/unexpected blockers\r\n-> Ensuring alignment with stakeholders\r\n\r\n2. Why looking for change? Why LinkedIn?\r\n3. Describe a situation where you showed operational excellence.\r\n4. Describe a situation where you suggested improvements in the project which other engineers in the team could leverage from.\r\n\r\nThen at the end, he threw a HLD problem for designing a LinkedIn internal notification system which can handle a very large scale.\r\nThere were few cross-questions regarding the different internal microservices and Kafka being used for async handling.\r\nThis just had 10-15 mins at the end. Luckily, I was able to create the HLD diagram covering all the components.\r\n\r\n**Verdict** : Selected for the staff role after a week.\r\n\r\n**Compensation details :** \r\nBase salary: 88 LPA\r\nTarget bonus : 13.2 LPA (min 15%)\r\nPF : 4.25 LPA\r\nRSU: 350k for 4 years, 75.6 LPA\r\nRelocation bonus/services: ~5 L\r\nNet CTC per year : 1.85 Cr PA\r\nYOE : 10\r\nCurrent CTC : 63 LPA (Microsoft : Senior SWE)\r\n\r\nHad another competing offers from Atlassian and Salesforce (~1.4 Cr PA), but finally I accepted the LinkedIn offer due to better role and compensation.\r\n\r\nThanks to the Leetcode community for helping during my preparation and it's my time to give back to the community. Cheers!\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "content": "Hi folks,\n\nI’m currently based in India and recently received a Senior Software Engineer offer from an Indian startup (founded in 2022). I’m reaching out to gather some perspectives as I’m a bit uncertain about whether to accept the offer.\n\nBackground:\n\nI have close to 4 years of experience working at a product-based startup.\n\nCurrent Company – Pros:\n\n1. Decent compensation and work-life balance\n2. Work from office (WFO) with flexible hours\n3. Work from home (WFH) is allowed when requested upto 4 in a month(though this flexibility is gradually being reduced)\n\nCurrent Company – Cons:\n1. Learning and growth have become stagnant\n2. Frequent and unclear policy changes\n3. Silent layoffs are happening — feels like a ticking time bomb\n4. Compensation isn't growing at a satisfying pace + have been there for 4 years\n\nNew Offer – Pros:\n\n1. Approximately a 25% hike in the cash component\n2. Steeper learning curve\n3. The company appears to be growing steadily\n\nNew Offer – Cons:\n\n1. Strict 5-day WFO with fixed entry hours\n2. Long working hours (10–11 hours/day), with increased pressure towards the end of the week to complete the deadlines\n3. Heavy workload, resulting in almost no work-life balance\n4. I noticed on LinkedIn that the tech team is relatively small (around 8–9 backend engineers), and most of them appear to have less experience than me. While I’m not judging, I do feel this might limit opportunities to learn from more experienced peers, which is something I value at this stage in my career.\n\nMy Dilemma:\n\nShould I put in my papers at the current company and treat this startup offer as a backup in case I don't land something better soon? Or should I stay put until I get an offer that’s more aligned with my expectations? I'm prioritizing both learning and mental health.\n\nI’d genuinely appreciate your advice and insights. I’m sure many of you have been through similar crossroads and can relate to the confusion.\n\nThanks in advance!",

    "content": "I wanted to share my full loop experience for Amazon SDE3/L6 role. Overall, the loop was intense and went on for 2 months. Here's the breakdown of each round:\n\nPhone Screen (DSA Focus)\n- Problem: Find the maximum total bitrate required by a video streaming service over time. I used a Line Sweep algorithm with a difference array approach.\n- Follow-up: Discussed strategies to handle large input files efficiently.\n- Leadership Principles (LPs): Focused on a project where I had to dive deep into technical data, propose solutions, and influence decisions. Got a lot of follow-ups on alternate approaches and what I could have done differently.\n\nRound 1: Low-Level Design\n- Topic: Design a monitoring and alert generation system based on metric streams.\n- Focus Areas: System extensibility, clean abstractions, and alert thresholds.\n- LPs: Insist on Highest Standards — discussion around setting quality benchmarks in large-scale React migrations.\n\nRound 2: High-Level Design\n- Topic: Hotel Booking System — end-to-end design for search and booking flows.\n- Expectations: Scalability, DB design, eventual consistency, and system evolution.\n- LPs: Dealing with ambiguity, long-term thinking.\n\nRound 3: DSA + Coding\nProblems:\n\n- [Task Scheduler](https://leetcode.com/problems/task-scheduler/)\n- [Bus Routes](https://leetcode.com/problems/bus-routes/)\n- LPs: Deliver Results — strong emphasis on impact and reliability.\n\nRound 4: Hiring Manager Round\n- Deep dive into past projects involving conflict management, mentorship, and delivering large-scale features.\n- Behavioral sections covered how I proposed initiatives that were initially rejected but eventually adopted.\n\nRound 5: Bar Raiser\n- Focused on innovation, design leadership, and proactive debugging.\n- Wanted detailed, structured examples of technical ownership and measurable impact.\n\n# **Offer**\n\n- Base: 85LPA\n- First Year Sign-on: ~50LPA\n- Second Year Sign-on: ~40LPA\n- RSUs: ~600 units (Back Loaded, Y1-5%, Y2-15%, Y3-40%, Y4-40%)\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n- Amazon interview loop is as much about system design and DSA as it is about how you demonstrate ownership and decision-making (LPs) through your past work.\n- Be ready for follow-up questions, they really dig into \"why\" and \"how\" behind each decision.\n- Most of the interviews went well beyond 60 minutes especially the HM round.\n- **Rejected** the offer\n\nYoE: 11 Years\nCurrent TC: ~1.2Cr PA\n\n",

Round 1 :**\r\nThis was a 50-minute DSA-focused interview. I was given a problem on **N-ary trees**, where only edges were provided as input. I had to build the tree and calculate the distance of each node from a given source. I completed the implementation and explanation within 30 minutes.\r\n\r\nIn the remaining time, the interviewer asked 3 follow-up questions based on the same problem, such as:\r\n\r\n- How to update distances if the root changes?\r\n- How to calculate the sum of distances from the root to all nodes?\r\n\r\nThe logic was of medium difficulty, but the implementation was slightly challenging. The interviewer was engaging and asked thoughtful cross-questions. I performed well and got selected for the next round.\r\n\r\n**3. Round 2 :** \r\nThis was also a 50-minute interview. The first question was a LeetCode problem (ID: 1443). Initially, I approached it incorrectly, but after some insightful cross-questioning from the interviewer, I realized the mistake and eventually arrived at the correct solution. I explained the logic clearly, and the code passed all test cases, which satisfied the interviewer.\r\n\r\nWith around 20–25 minutes remaining, he gave me a recursion-based problem. I first explained the brute-force approach. He then added more context to the problem, guiding it towards a Trie-based solution. I explained the optimized approach using Trie, which he liked. He only asked for the logic, not the full implementation.\r\n\r\nIn the last 5–10 minutes, he asked a web development question: how uploading a PDF to a web app works.\r\n\r\nThe round went well overall, and I was selected for the next round.\r\n\r\n\r\n**4. Co-founder Round :** \r\nThis was a 30-minute video call with the co-founder. The conversation began with a brief introduction, followed by some typical HR questions, such as \"Where do you see yourself in the next 5 years?\"—overall, it was a casual and engaging discussion.\r\n\r\nI was also asked to give a demo of my project, which he liked. Towards the end, I asked about Even's long-term vision and future plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Final Verdict :** Rejected\r\n\r\nThe final round was a good and engaging conversation. I felt it went well, but unfortunately, I was not selected. The exact reason wasn’t shared, so I'm not sure what led to the rejection.\r\n\r\n",

    "content": "Hi guys so recently I had the opportunity to interview with PhonePe as I was already on my notice period in Inmobi-Glance and I was having an offer from [ShareChat](https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/6713813/sharechat-offer-sde-1-bengaluru-by-shubh-z9vm/) which I also had shared earlier.\n\nI got this interview through a referral from a PhonePe employee.\n\nSo the interview initially consisted of 4 Rounds only for SDE (Android) role. And those were:\n\n- DSA Round\n- Android Platform Round\n- Machine Coding Round (Android)\n- HM Round\n\nLet's go thorugh each and every round one by one-\n\n\n**DSA Round** - In this round I was asked 2 DSA questions. The time duration of this round was 1 hour only and I had to solve both the questions in that time limit only. \n\nThe first question was from Graphs topic and I must say that I am not very strong in Graphs and I was not expecting any Graphs question but it was my first question. \n\nQuestion was similar to : https://leetcode.com/problems/loud-and-rich/description/\n\nLiterally I took a lot of time to firstly understand the problem then came to an unoptimised approach to which interviewer was not that happy.\n\nThen after 30 minutes he presented me another question.\n\nQuestion was: https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-ii/description/\n\nI solved this problem optimially before the given time limit and the interviewer was happy with my solution.\n\n\nI totally lost my hope for next round but luckily I got call from recruiter the next day for next round :)\n\n\n**Android Platform Round** - This round mainly revolved around basic android topics like ViewModel and its working, Activities, Fragments, Jetpack Compose.\n\nInterviewer mainly dig deeper on topics like Services and its usecases which I comfortably answered. \n\nThere was no question from his side which I was not able to answer correctly.\n\nGot a call from recruiter that I had cleared this round as well. Scheduled my next round the same day.\n\n**Machine Coding Round** - In this round I was given a problem to design a E-Commerce app and how will I be managing the data between different screens.\n\nThe data should also be synced with the backend servers.\n\nSO I basically was given some 4-5 criterias or features to complete in 90 minutes with scalable and clean code.\n\nI followed MVVM + Clean Architecture in Android for this round. Firstly I told my approach to the interviewer and discussed a bit on this part. \n\nThen when we were on same ground I started coding and I did it really fast as I had to complete all the features in the given time limit.\n\nI did exceptionally well in this round that interviewer even praised me at last.\n\nThen I got a call that I am eligible for HM Round. It was then scheduled for the next day.\n\n**HM Round** - In this round the Hiring Manager discussed about my experience at Inmobi-Glance and I told whatever I had done in my 1.5 years of FTE at Inmobi-Glance.\n\nThen he passed me an open ended question to design a map app and I had to tell him my approach in such a way that it is optimal and can be transformed into a market ready app with that approach.\n\nWe discussed a lot and then he asked some really tough behavioural questions to me which I answered confidently.\n\nI felt this round as the most difficult one.\n\n\n**Unexpected happened** : I was celebrating my farewell at my office (Inmobi-Glance) and I was pretty confident to get the offer that dat on May 30. Then HR called me and told me that there is a good and a bad news for me. I was shocked to hear this.\n\nHe told me that the collective feedback is mostly positive and they can consider me for an offer but I had to go through a **Bar-Raiser Round** due to my average performance in **DSA Round**\n\nI literally was weeping from inside and multiple thoughts were running in my mind like: \"May be they have found someone else that's why to reject me taking another round\" etc etc.\n\nBut still I somehow managed myself and I agreed to his request.\n\nThe fact was that I also did not have any laptop to prepare for this round as I had submitted my mac back to my organization (Inmobi-Glance).\n\nI borrowed a laptop from my friend and logged in my leetcode account and started preparing from next day.\n\n**Bar-Raiser Round** - In this round I was asked 2 questions. And this round I would say was the most easy round.\n\nThe first question was based on \"Min-Heap\" which I solved optimally.\n\nThe second question was based on some strings like some word and pattern problem. I solved this also optimally.\n\nThen that evening I got a call from recruiter that I had successfully cleared this round as well.\n\nThey were ready to give me an offer. And after 2-3 days I had my compensation call with my HM.\n\nThere we discussed my compensation.\n\nCompensation details: https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/6817292/phonepe-offer-software-development-engin-e294/\n\nNow please help what should I choose at this point of time ?\n\nShareChat or PhonePe ?\n\nPlease help me.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi LC community, sharing my Amazon offer compensation for SDE-1 role. Hope it serves as a clarity and motivation to my fellow mates. 😊\n\n- **Education**: Tier - 3 College | CSE\n- **YOE**: 1+ years Full-time | ~1 year interships\n- **Company**: ***Amazon***\n- **Designation**: SDE - 1\n- **Base Pay (INR)**: 19,17,000\n- **Sign-on Bonus Year 1 (INR)**: 6,47,000\n- **Sign-on Bonus Year 2 (INR)**: 5,18,000\n- **Restricted Stock Unit Value (RSU) (4 years) * (INR)**: 15,56,000\n- **The RSU vesting cycle**: 5% after Year 1, 15% after Year 2; and thereafter, 20% every six months until fully vested.\n- **Total Compensation (INR)**: 46,28,000\n- **Benefits**: Standard Amazon benifits\n\nIn my opinion Amazon is the relatively easiest to crack in FAANG companies as SDE-1. You can significantly boost your career from this point. Hoping the same in my case.\n\nBe good with LC Mediums and few Hards if your are targeting this company as SDE-1. You should be in a position to think of the solution back of your head the moment question is given. Only then you can solve both the questions in 45mins with all the Brute-force to optimal explanations. Rest 15mins will be for Introductions, Leadership principle questions and some buffer for DSA follow-ups.\n\n**Keep grinding and the day will definitely come**.\n\n***Everything happens at the right time!***\n***Jai Shree Krishna🕉️***\n\n**Update**:\n**My interview experience**:\n\nAlthough I couldn't remember all the questions. I do remember two of them:\n1. https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/description/\n2. https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-bridge/description/\n\nRemaining were also of similar difficulties. Now its not like your regular contest. In almost all questions you won't be given all details and they expect us to get all the clarity and details by asking questions to them. So there will some time invested for this thing too.\n\nI also faced a situation for the Rain water trapping question the Bar-raiser asked it in last 25mins. He didn't even paste the problem statement, he just pasted an array and gave some vague statement via mouth without even the expected answer. Now you should also be in a state to handle these kind of treatment imagining and solving it in mind with all brute to optimal solutions. Forget about using pen-paper because I didn't even get time to touch them in any of my rounds.\n\n**Timeline for my rounds and offer**:\nFor all my rounds recruiter reached out to me the **next** day of interview round and with 2-3 days gaps for next round. Then finally after 2-3 days of my Bar-raiser round received the offer ✅.\n\n**LP questions guide**:\nFollow this thread for LP questions. Mostly they ask from here with slight change:\nhttps://leetcode.com/discuss/post/437082/amazon-behavioral-questions-leadership-p-kvhl/\n\n\n![image.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/720b12e5-0562-4935-a3cd-d6882b969142_1743871228.1200168.png)",

    "content": "Hello everyone!  \nI recently received an **SDE-1 offer from Amazon AUTA** and wanted to share my complete interview experience to help others in their preparation.\nFor those currently in the process of Amazon, this post will really help you to keep your hopes high. The entire process lasted about 6 months (Application submission in December 2024, Offer in June 2025)\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 Online Assessment (OA)\n\n**Date:** Jan 2025\n\n**Platform:** HackerRank  \n**Duration:** 3-4 hours\n\n### Structure:\n- **Part 1:** 2 DSA questions, Medium Difficulty\n- **Part 2:** Work Simulation, Leadership Principles\n\n### Coding Questions:\n1. Greedy based medium difficulty question\n2. Simulation type tree question, got MLE on recursive solution, passed all test cases on iterative solution.\n\n### My Approach:\n\nSolved both the DSA questions in under 45 mins, and then took the rest of the time to solve leadership and work simulation parts.\n\n---\n\n## 🗣️ Round 1 – Technical Interview (DSA)\n\n**Date:** March 2025 \n**Duration:** ~60 minutes  \n**Platform:** Amazon Chime\n**Note:** This round was re-scheduled two times, both the time interviewers did not show up :( .\n\n### Questions:\n1. Problem 1: https://leetcode.com/problems/capacity-to-ship-packages-within-d-days/description/\n- Had Solved this problem before, came with an optimal solution in 15-20 mins.\n2. Problem 2: Similar to : https://leetcode.com/problems/asteroid-collision/description/\n - Hard difficulty, came with the code for a semi-optimal solution, gave an approach in the end for a optimal solution.\n \n3. Leadership Questions and Questions about my current company.\n\n---\n\n## 💻 Round 2 – Technical Interview (DSA)\n\n**Date:** May 2025\n**Duration:** ~75 minutes  \n**Platform:** Amazon Chime\n**Note:** Got a mail after one week after round-1 stating that I cleared the previous round and will have a  second round. Later I got the schedule, but this is where I occurred alot of issues. I had this round re-scheduled a total of **7 times**, with most of the times interviewer simply did not show up without any prior communication. Really lost hope and in the end, but atlast my interview did happen.\n\n### Questions:\n1. Problem 1 : https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-image/description/\n- Came up with a solution in under 15-20mins, medium dificulty.\n2. Problem 2: Similar to : https://leetcode.com/problems/next-permutation/\n- Hard Difficulty (for me), Although I had solved this prior, I had no idea for the optimal solution. I tried to come up with an optimal approach, came up with a solution, but did not have the time left to code. Interviewer was mildly satisfied. \n\n3. Standard LP questions\n\n---\n\n## 🤝 Round 3 – Bar Raiser (Behavioral + LP + DSA)\n\n**Date:** May 2025\n**Duration:** ~60 minutes  \n**Platform:** Amazon Chime\n**Note** : Got a mail after a week of round-2 that i have cleared the round, and they are acitvely working on scheduling my round -3. Got a call from Loop scheduler 1.5 weeks after for the round to be scheduled on Saturday, I immediately agreed (as I had 0 holidays left due Round-2 being re-scheduled so many times), and I got the mail for schedule. Suprisingly there were two interviewers, one really senior, one SDE-2.\nOne more thing, this specific mail did not have live code link, thus I was not expecting a DSA question, but in the interview it was asked.\n\n### Format:\n- 30 mins LP Questions.\n- 30 mins DSA Question\n\n### Questions:\n1. **Leadership Principles**  \n  - Tell me about a time you got feedback\n  - Tell me about a time you faced critical issues\n  - Tell me about a time you went beyond your task/job\n  - Follow ups on all\n\n2. **DSA**\n- Problem : https://leetcode.com/problems/count-number-of-nice-subarrays/description/\n- Came up with a 2-pass approach, interviewer was satisfied enough, medium difficulty.\n\n---\n## Current Package\n\n**CTC** : 7 LPA\n**YOE** : 9 Months\n___\n\n## 📬 Offer\n\n**Role:** SDE-1  \n**Location:** Bengaluru\n**Date** : June 2025\n\n**Package** : \n**Base Pay** : 19,17,000\n**Sign-on Bonus Year 1 (INR)**: 6,47,000\n**Sign-on Bonus Year 2 (INR)** :5,18,000\n**Restricted Stock Unit Value (RSU) (4 years)(INR)**:15,56,000\n\n**Total CTC** : 48 L + \n\n**Note**: Recieved the offer after almost 2.5 weeks after the the last round, I was constantly mailing the loop scheduler back and in the end the recruiter finally called me.\n\n___\n\n### Tips (Important)\n\n- Solve standard DSA sheets, interview questions are mostly asked around these with most of them being medium difficulty.\n- Dont wait for the reply, simply mail the loop scheduler mail back for an update, my loop mail thread was around **40 mails**.\n- For LP questions, prepare a list of 30-40 questions, you can easily find on leetcode, and run a deep research query on chatgpt along with your resume, get STAR based answers, and have follow up answers also prepared.\n\n___\n\n### Final Thoughts:\n\nI am really grateful to recieve this offer and finally my hardwork did pay off. I hope this post will help other people around who are in the process, and feel like they stuck in the re-scheduling loop.\n\n---\n\n*Feel free to ask questions in the comments. Happy to help! 😊*\n\n",

    "content": "Excited to share that I've recieved an offer for a Senior Software Engineer role at Uber! It was a challenging and rewarding interview process, and I wanted to share my experience for anyone preparing.\n\n---\n\n### Round 1: Data Structures & Algorithms (1 hour)\n\nThis round focused on core DSA concepts.\n\n* **Question:** Given a list of (label, weight) pairs, implement a function to randomly select a label with a probability proportional to its weight.\n* **Follow-up 1:** How would you handle floating-point weights?\n* **Follow-up 2:** How would you modify your solution to use only constant additional space ($O(1)$)?\n\n**My take:** The round went well. I managed to solve all parts of the question, including the follow-ups, within the time limit. The key was to think about weighted probability and then optimize for space.\n\n---\n\n### Round 2: Data Structures & Algorithms (1 hour)\n\nAnother hour of DSA, with two distinct problems.\n\n* **Question 1:** You're given a set of subsequences of an array. Reconstruct the original array, which contains no duplicate elements. If multiple solutions are possible, return the lexicographically smallest one. Return -1 if no solution exists.\n* **Question 2:** Write a function that takes an integer and returns the smallest palindrome greater than that integer.\n\n**My take:** This was a great round! I found optimal solutions for both problems and the interviewer seemed pleased with the approach and the code quality. All code had to be executable on a shared IDE.\n\n---\n\n### Round 3: Backend Low-Level Design (LLD) (1 hour 15 mins)\n\nThis was a hands-on coding round focused on building a system from scratch.\n\n* **Question:** Design an in-memory ride-sharing system with the following methods:\n    * `DriverGoOnline(driverId, location, currentTime)`\n    * `RiderRequest(A, B, currentTime)` → returns `(driverId, price, timeOfPickup)`\n    * `DriverGoOffline(driverId, currentTime)`\n* **Follow-up 1 (Dynamic Pricing):** Implement a 1.5x surcharge if fewer than three drivers are available.\n* **Follow-up 2 (Driver Queueing):** If no drivers are available, assign the ride to the driver who will become free the soonest.\n* **Follow-up 3 (Extensible Pricing):** Create a separate, configurable pricing class that can factor in time of day, number of available drivers, and recent ride requests in the area.\n\n**My take:** This round was intense and went over time. The interviewer really pushed me on extensibility and design principles. Although I was grilled quite a bit, I felt I did a solid job building a robust solution.\n\n---\n\n### Round 4: System Design (HLD) (1 hour 15 mins)\n\nA deep dive into high-level system architecture.\n\n* **Question:** Design an online Tic-Tac-Toe game.\n\n**My take:** This was the toughest round. The interviewer was a Principal Engineer with a phenomenal grasp of system design. We went way over the scheduled time, and honestly, my brain was fried by the end. While I held my own, I struggled with a few areas, particularly with time management and couldn't detail the storage solution as thoroughly as I wanted.\n\n---\n\n### Round 5: Collaboration & Leadership (75 mins)\n\nThis round was split into two parts.\n\n* **Part 1 (Deep Dive):** An end-to-end discussion of a complex project I've worked on, covering its architecture, what I'd improve, and how we ensure its observability.\n* **Part 2 (Leadership):** Behavioral questions focused on:\n    * Resolving technical conflicts between team members.\n    * Mentorship and engineering citizenship.\n    * Handling critical feedback from a manager.\n    * Initiatives I've led outside of my direct responsibilities.\n\n**My take:** I think this round went quite well. I started off a bit slow, giving too much detail, but then picked up the pace. The leadership questions were straightforward, and I was able to draw on my past experiences effectively.\n\n---\n\n### The Result\n\nI received very positive feedback: **Strong Hire** for DSA & LLD, and **Hire** for HLD and the collaboration round.\n\nUltimately, I was thrilled to receive an offer!\n\n* **Total Compensation:** ~₹1.2 Cr per annum\n    * **Base:** ₹75L\n    * **Target Bonus:** ₹15L\n    * **Stocks (RSUs):** ₹25L per year\n\n",

    "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm in a bit of a dilemma and would really appreciate guidance from seniors or amazonians.\n\nI recently received an offer from Amazon Pay for an FTC (Fixed-Term Contract) role. I currently work at a Service-Based Company with around 1 year 10 months of experience, and my current CTC is 7.5 LPA.\n\nSome important context:\n\n1. I’m a Java Backend Developer, but currently I'm doing support work with very minimal development exposure.\n\n2. My DSA is decent – I have a 1950+ rating on LeetCode, and I’m a Specialist on Codeforces.\n\n3. I'm the only earning member in my family, so job stability is very important to me.\n\n4. 90-day notice perio:- I am not sure but after discussion with HM i felt that, they might wait.\n\n5. The role is a 12-month FTC, with a possibility of extension or conversion — but nothing is guaranteed.\n\n6. The expected compensation is around 18–20 LPA.\n\nNow I’m confused — this could be a great learning opportunity, a strong brand name on my resume, and a way to escape service based company. But the risk of being jobless after 12 months or early is very real, especially since I support my family.\n\n\nit will be great someone experienced or \nYour honest feedback would mean a lot. Thank you in advance.",

    "content": "Receieved a Senior Engineer (P50) offer from Atlassian! The interview process was one of the most comprehensive I've experienced, going deep into technical skills, design philosophy, and values. Here’s a breakdown of my journey.\n\n---\n\n### Round 1: The Karat Screening (1 hour)\n\nThis initial round, run by Karat, was an eliminator. It was a fast-paced hour covering a wide array of high-level design and DSA problems. You had to think on your feet!\n\n* **Question 1 (Database Design):** For a Facebook clone, how would you design the system to efficiently display a user's current friend count next to every post they've made? The challenge was scaling this for a massive read-heavy load.\n* **Question 2 (System Critiquing):** For a Google Docs clone where each doc is tied to a single server, critique a round-robin load-balancing strategy. I pointed out issues with potential \"hotspots\" (popular documents overwhelming a single server) and lack of consideration for server capacity.\n* **Question 3 (Consistency Models):** Choose between Strong and Eventual Consistency for:\n    1.  A low-latency video metadata API (Eventual was my choice for speed).\n    2.  A web analytics platform logging every click (Eventual, as losing a single click is not catastrophic).\n    3.  A banking system (Strong, as transactional integrity is paramount).\n* **Question 4 (Distributed Systems):** For an e-signature service handling billions of documents, a bug caused notification failures. Given logs from 500 servers (only showing successes) and a database of completed documents, how would you find all the missed notifications at scale? The discussion centered on distributed data reconciliation, likely using a MapReduce or Spark job.\n* **Question 5 & 6 (Pipeline Analysis):** Given a multi-stage, branching pipeline for notifying users of a security breach, what is its maximum throughput? The task was to identify the narrowest path (the bottleneck stage). The follow-up was to suggest optimizations, like parallelizing independent stages.\n* **Question 7 (DSA):** For a social network, you get a stream of `CONNECT` and `DISCONNECT` events. Write a function that takes this log and a number `N` to return two lists: users with fewer than `N` connections and users with `N` or more. A hash map to track connection counts was the way to go.\n\n**My take:** The sheer breadth was the main challenge. I provided solid high-level logic and cleared the round, which opened the door for the full virtual onsite.\n\n---\n\n### Round 2: Data Structures & Algorithms (1 hour)\n\nA classic DSA deep dive.\n\n* **Question:** Design an in-memory data structure to handle a stream of `<timestamp, commodityPrice>` data. The structure needed to support out-of-order and duplicate timestamps (updating the price) and efficiently return the maximum commodity price seen so far.\n\n**My take:** The emphasis was on writing a modular, optimal, and fully working solution. I used an online IDE which helped speed things up. The round went smoothly, and I completed the implementation successfully.\n\n---\n\n### Round 3: Backend Coding & LLD (1 hour)\n\nThis round blended low-level design with implementation.\n\n* **Question:** Design a system for rating customer support agents. Implement two methods:\n    1.  `void giveRating(String agentName, int rating)`\n    2.  `List<Agent> getRatings()` which returns agents sorted from highest to lowest average rating.\n* **Follow-up 1:** The `getRatings()` call is becoming slow. How do you optimize it? (My solution involved pre-calculating and caching the sorted list, updating it only when new ratings come in).\n* **Follow-up 2:** How would you break ties in ratings? Discuss and implement alternate approaches. (We discussed tie-breaking strategies like using the total number of ratings or the timestamp of the most recent rating).\n\n**My take:** The problem was a vehicle to discuss design trade-offs. The interviewer was assessing my ability to write clean code and think about scalability from the ground up.\n\n---\n\n### Round 4: System Design - HLD (1 hour+)\n\nThe most intense technical round.\n\n* **Question:** Design a product-agnostic tagging system for all of Atlassian. Users on Jira, Confluence, or Bitbucket should be able to tag content (Issues, Pages, PRs). The system must power three key features: adding/removing tags, viewing all content for a given tag, and a dashboard for popular tags.\n\n**My take:** This was a grilling session. The interviewer pushed hard on API design (RESTful endpoints, request/response payloads) and especially on database schema and choices (SQL vs. NoSQL, indexing strategies for the tags-to-content join table). I left feeling unsure, as every small detail I proposed was deeply questioned. It felt like a test of how I'd handle pressure in a real architectural debate.\n\n---\n\n### Round 5: Management & Leadership Interview (1 hour)\n\nThis interview was with a Senior Engineering Manager and focused entirely on my experiences as an engineer beyond just code.\n\n* **Pillars:** The questions revolved around Owning Outcomes, Operational Excellence, and Leadership.\n\n**My take:** I came prepared with detailed examples for each pillar. The key is to present complex, scalable situations and clearly articulate the challenge, your specific actions, and the measurable impact.\n\n---\n\n### Round 6: Atlassian Values Interview (1 hour)\n\nThe final round, with a Senior Software Engineer, was a conversation to see if I was a good fit for Atlassian's unique culture.\n\n* **Values:** The discussion was structured around Atlassian's core values \n* **Sample Questions:**\n    * \"Describe a time you had a direct and difficult conversation with a colleague about their work. How did you approach it?\"\n    * \"Tell me about a time you went above and beyond your defined role to help your team succeed.\"\n\n**My take:** This felt like a natural conversation. The interviewer was friendly, and having my stories from the management round fresh in my mind helped. It was about authenticity and demonstrating that my personal work ethic aligns with their values.\n\n---\n\n### The Feedback & Result\n\nI received overall positive feedback and a **\"Hiring Committee Select\"**!\n\nI specifically asked about the HLD round that I was worried about. The recruiter mentioned there were no red flags and that the interviewer was likely just testing how I handle pressure. What a relief! After a few team-matching calls, the offer was rolled out.\n\n### Final Offer\n\n* **Total Compensation:** ~₹1.4 CR per annum\n    * **Base Salary:** ₹90L\n    * **Target Bonus:** ₹10L\n    * **Joining Bonus:** ₹5L\n    * **RSUs:** ₹35L per year\n",

But I am not in a position to relocate. I still have one year if I change my mind.\n\n\n**Rejections:** Stripe and Google\nGoogle, I felt I was a bit unlucky. Got an interviewer who was least interested in the interview and didnt seem like one who wanted the candidate to succeed. He ended up giving a Strong No hire. \nAs for Stripe, no complaints here, I seriously messed up one of my rounds and knew I will be rejected. \n\n\n**Views on the market**: The market is tough right now — even one weak round can lead to rejection or down-leveling. That being said, good prep still goes a long way. Roles are fewer, but companies continue to hire top talent.\n\n**Tips and strategies**: \nOne notable shift I observed was the reduced emphasis on traditional LeetCode-style problems. For example, companies like Samsara and Stripe didn’t include any such rounds. The focus has moved towards medium-level coding problems with more weight on how you approach the problem, your code structure, modularity, edge case handling, and overall discussion. Only Meta and Google still stick to hardcore LC-style questions.\n\nFor System Design, senior roles now expect staff-level depth. And don’t ignore the behavioral rounds — they’re critical. A weak showing here can lead to down-leveling, regardless of technical performance.",

    "content": "## 🆘 Struggling to Land Offers – Need Career Guidance & Help Exploring International Opportunities\n\nHi everyone, I’m posting this anonymously because I’m truly looking for honest guidance and support from this amazing community. I'm at a crossroads in my career and could really use some direction.\n\n### 📌 My Background:\n\n* **Experience**: \\~2 years in the industry.\n* **DSA Skills**: Strong (solving regularly on LeetCode).\n* **System Design**: Basic, currently brushing up.\n* **Education**: Tier-2 college in India.\n* **Ambition**: Want to unlock better compensation and career growth, either within India or internationally.\n\n### 📉 My Situation:\n\nI’ve been working in the same company for over 1.5 years, expecting an SDE-2 promotion (as per early feedback), but due to budget constraints, I didn't get the promotion or even a hike for the last **2 years** — whereas my teammates did. Every time I ask my manager, I’m told I’m doing more than enough — but nothing changes.\n\nSo, I’ve decided to **start job hunting seriously.**\nBut here’s the issue — **no callbacks, no interview messages, not even replies on LinkedIn**, despite reaching out to a lot of people. It’s disheartening.\n\nThis pattern isn’t new — during my college days too, I sent **1000+ applications and DMs** and gave **150+ online assessments**, but got very few opportunities. I’m not sure if it’s bad luck, a strategy problem, or something else.\n\n### 🙏 What I Need Help With:\n\n1. **Career Guidance**: How should I navigate from here? Is it still possible to grow well despite the setbacks?\n2. **Resume Advice**:\n\n   * Should I stick to a 1-page resume?\n   * How important are projects at this stage of my career?\n3. **International Offers**:\n\n   * How can someone from India explore international opportunities? (Especially without a master's degree due to familys financial constraints)\n4. **Preparation Strategy**:\n\n   * What topics should I master for interviews?\n   * Please suggest any quality resources for System Design, DSA, and interview prep.\n5. **Job-Shifting Documentation**:\n\n   * What documents should I keep ready when planning to switch companies?\n6. **Application Strategy**:\n\n   * How do I get recruiters to notice me? Any tips that worked for you?\n\n### 💭 Final Thoughts:\n\nI’m highly motivated, and I feel like I have much more to offer than my current situation reflects. I’ve kept going despite many rejections — but I don’t want to keep repeating the same mistakes.\n\nIf you’ve been in a similar situation or have advice, please drop your thoughts here. 🙌\nEven one helpful response can make a big difference to someone trying hard to turn things around.\n",

I recently received two offers and I’m struggling to decide.  \n\nEdit: I have decided to join Oracle for now! (As its still higher in compensation(RSUs >> esops) and in the hope of better WLB. Also I have heard Oracle is WFH for now!). \n\n### **Offers Received:**  \n🔹 **Flipkart (SDE-2)**  \n- **Compensation:** 28 LPA + 10% performance bonus  \n- **Stock Grant:** 16.7K dollars (vested equally over 4 years)  \n- Total: ~34 LPA\n- **Negotiation:** Attempted, but they didn’t initially budge.  \n\n🔹 **Oracle Health (SMTS)**  \n- **Compensation:** 38 LPA  \n- **ESOPs:** $45K (vested over 4 years: 40%, 30%, 20%, 10%) \n- Total: ~54 LPA \n\n### **Situation:**  \n- Initially, I was set to join Flipkart.  \n- A week before my joining, I received Oracle’s offer.  \n- I re-negotiated with Flipkart, and they matched the **fixed + variable** (34 LPA + 10% bonus) along with the same stocks.  \n- On my joining day, I didn’t show up at Flipkart, and later they called, saying they might **match my Oracle offer** if I was still open to joining.  \n\n### **Concerns:**  \n- I haven’t heard of Flipkart offering **this much** for an SDE-2 role. Is this a **red flag**?  \n- **Work culture & balance** matter more to me than just compensation. I’d prefer **good work + good work-life balance** over **best work + poor balance**.  \n\nWould love to hear your thoughts!  \nWhat would you choose in my place?  \nHow is the work-life balance at **Flipkart vs. Oracle Health**?  \n\nAppreciate any detailed insights! 🙌  \n\n",

I’ve been deeply passionate about coding and problem-solving, and have consistently worked on upskilling myself.\r\n\r\nFor the past 2 years, I’ve been practicing Data Structures and Algorithms and can confidently solve 80% of LeetCode problems.\r\n\r\nOn the development side, I have strong frontend expertise in Angular and React, and backend skills using Node.js, Express, and NestJS.\r\n\r\nI’ve worked with React Native, designed UI/UX for client projects, and used Google Cloud Platform (GCP) in my current role.\r\n\r\nDespite all this, my current salary is just 6 LPA, which is less than half of what most developers with similar experience are earning. Unfortunately, most companies base hikes on current salary, not skillset, and I’ve also found it difficult to negotiate due to lack of guidance. As a result, I feel stuck, even though I know I’m doing better than many peers.\r\n\r\nI’m now wondering:\r\n\r\nShould I keep growing at my current pace and trust that the right opportunity will come,\r\nor do I need to change something in how I approach my career and visibility?\r\n\r\nAny advice, tips, or personal stories would mean a lot to me right now.

    "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’d really appreciate any insights on my current situation. I’ve been working at a product-based MNC since graduation and have recently started preparing for a switch, aiming for FAANG or similar companies to bring my compensation up to market standards. I’ve just received an offer from a mid-sized startup I interviewed with.\n\nBackground:\nCollege: Tier 2 (NIT)\nExperience: ~4 years\nDomain: Backend Java, Big Data, Distributed Systems\n\nCurrent Employer: Product-based MNC\nCurrent Compensation: ~25 LPA (20L Fixed + 4L Variable + Misc)\n\nNew Employer: US-based startup (4 years old, <100 employees globally, <10 in India), Hybrid role\nOffer: 34 LPA (32L Fixed + 2L PF) + ESOPs (1-year vesting period)\nTech Stack: Node.js, TypeScript – full-stack role\n\nThe work-life balance at the startup seems decent based on my chats with current employees. The company appears stable for at least the next year or two. The offer is a decent bump over my current compensation, though not as high as one might typically expect from startups. The ESOPs, for now, are just on paper. Further negotiation doesn’t seem to be an option at this point.\n\nMy dilemma:\n- Does this seem like a good offer in today’s market for someone with my background and experience?\n\n- Should I accept the offer or continue preparing for FAANG or equivalent opportunities? Staying at my current job while preparing and interviewing for a few months would be much easier than transitioning into a fast-paced startup environment during that time.\n\nWould really appreciate your thoughts. Thanks!",

After completing all the interview rounds, the HR called and informed me that I had cleared all of them. However, she also mentioned that there's currently a hiring freeze due to internal restructuring.\n\nShe said they will reach out to me with the offer once hiring resumes, but didn’t provide a clear timeline. Now I’m confused — does this mean I’m selected and just waiting for the freeze to lift, or is this a soft rejection?\n\nHas anyone faced a similar situation?

    "content": "Hi Guys, \r\nI wanted to share my experience of getting an offer from Amazon for SDE-1 position at Bangalore. I wanted to give back to the community and help others like it helped me a lot during my preparations.\r\n\r\n1. OA - Somwhere in March (Don't remember the exact date) - 2.5 hours\r\n    - 2 DSA questions\r\n    - Amazon's work simulator test\r\n    - Situational MCSQs\r\n\r\n- Got email on 16-April-2025 that I cleared OA and have my interviews on 22 and 23 April.\r\n\r\n2. Technical Round 1 - 22 April 2025 - 1 hour\r\n    - Leadership Principle question:\r\n        - Tell a time when you had to become a Subject Matter Expert to develop a feature you needed. Specify all tasks you did and outcome.\r\n        - Multiple Follow-ups on above question\r\n    - 1 DSA (Coding) Question:\r\n        - Related to Priority Queues (can't disclose the exact question due to NDA)\r\n        - Also required OOPS based implementation\r\n\r\n- Got email within 1 hour via Loop Scheduler for second technical round.\r\n\r\n3. Technical Round 2 - 23 April 2025 - 1 hour\r\n    - Leadership Principle question:\r\n        - Tell about a time where you could not deliever a product within deadline and how did you convey this to stakeholders\r\n        - Tell about a time when you went on and helped someone (your peer) at your work.\r\n        - Tell about a time when you made some feature in a week or two, but then found out it was not what you wanted and you need to revamp\r\n    - 1 DSA (Coding) Question:\r\n        -  Again related to Priority Queues (The question was very vague and was just a single line statement)\r\n        - No testcase, no examples provided, had to ask clarifications by myself and think of all examples and edge cases on my own and discuss with interviewer.\r\n        - It also required OOPS based implementation\r\n        - Also optimizations were asked as follow up which were related to deadlock handling and synchronization for parallel tasks.\r\n\r\n- Got email again within 1 hour for Round 3 (Bar raiser).\r\n\r\n4. Bar Raiser Round 3 - 28 April 2025 - 35 minutes\r\n    It was an all LP round and no DSA or coding questions were asked.\r\n    - Leadership Principle questions:\r\n        - Tell about a feature you developed end-to-end, what all options did you explore and what all choices did you make and why?\r\n        - Tell about a time when you recieved a critical feedback from your manager and how did you took it?\r\n        - Tell about a time when you had different choice for something but your colleague had a different opinion and how did you convince them to go with yours?\r\n        - Tell about a time when you had to deliver a feature in a tighter deadline and you did not get chance to explore all options?\r\n        - Tell about a time when you had to research a lot to reach your goal? (dive deep) (don't remember the exact question but was almost similar to it)\r\n\r\n    - Follow-up questions were asked on every question above.\r\n\r\n- Got a call from recruiter on 8th May 2025 that I cleared all rounds and they are extending me an offer. Also got the offer confirmation mail the same day within 3 hours of the call.\r\n\r\nThe compensation is same as for other SDE-1 offers which many people have posted already in the discussion.\r\n\r\nAt the end I just want to say that, don't stop, keep giving your 100% and do believe in yourself and rest all will be taken care by God!\r\n\r\nJai Shree Ram!",

    "content": "This community has given a lot to me, so I wanted to share my Google interview experience to give something back. I hope it helps you on your journey!\n\n# Timeline: \n\n- Early Feb: Recruiter reached out\n- Mid Feb: Phone Screening Round\n- Early April: All 3 technical onsite rounds\n- Late April: Googlyness Round \n- Early May: Hiring Manager Round\n- Mid May: Offer!\n\n# Interview Experience: \n\n**Phone Screening Round:**\n*Problem:* https://leetcode.com/problems/separate-squares-i/description/. There was a big story around this problem but in essence it was the question I have linked above. I solved the problem without taking any hints but my implementation of binary search on decimal values was a bit messy. The interviewer asked me to spend more time refining it, which I did.\n\n*My thoughts:* I hadn't seen this problem before the interview but found it afterward. I felt a bit slow and over-communicated at times, but the interviewer seemed satisfied with my approach. However, the interviewer was satisfied with my approach so I was hopeful. \n\n*Result:* Recruiter called and said the feedback is positive but I could have done better time management. I believe the interviewer would have asked this problem as a follow up: https://leetcode.com/problems/separate-squares-ii/description/ but there was no time left. However, since the screening round only has Hire/No Hire verdicts, so mine would have been Hire.\n\n\n**Onsite Round 1:**\n*Problem:* You are working on a data sequence but the data is too big. Fortunately the data has a lot of repeated values.So you would want use the run-length encoding (RLE) compression technique.\n\n```\nInput: \n2, 1, 1, 2, 5, 5, 3, 3\nOutput (RLE would look like):\n2 ->1, 1 -> 2, 2 -> 1, 5 -> 2, 3 -> 2\n```\n\nWrite a method to do this encoding. \n\nFollow up 1: Given the encoded list and an index, return the value that was present at that index in the original list. \nFollow up 2: Assume the original list was sorted. You are given the encoded list of the original list and a value. You need to return the index of the first occurrence of this value in the original list. \n\n*My thoughts:* The problem was initially vague, so I had to ask a lot of clarification questions. Once we narrowed it down to a list of integers, the implementation was straightforward. I was able to solve the follow ups as well with minimal changes in code for the original problem. I was feeling confident and was expecting a strong positive feedback. \n\n\n*Result:* The recruiter's feedback was positive, but she did mention a couple of issues, specifically that my code focused only on one data type. This came as a surprise to me, but I guess the interviewer expected better clarification questions and better scoping from my end. My expectation of this round was Strong Hire but based on recruiter's feedback I think it would have been a Hire. \n\n\n**Onsite Round 2:**\n*Problem:* https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/6551079/google-data-engineer-screening-round-by-7zhd9/. \n\nThe interviewer joined 5 minutes late and then proceeded to type out the question instead of pasting it. This easily wasted about 20 minutes. Luckily I had solved this question before and was able to come up with the solution very quickly. There was scope for optimization but they did not ask for it. Instead, with around 7-10 mins remaining they said they will ask language (cpp) specific questions. He wrote down these method signatures and asked me multiple questions around the same: \n```\n1. Node Merge(const Node& n1, const Node& n2) \n2. Node Merge(const Node n1, const Node n2) \n3. Node Merge(const Node* n1, const Node* n2) \n4. Node Merge(Node* n1,  Node* n2) \n5. Node Merge(Node& n1, Node& n2) \n6. Node Merge(Node&& n1, Node&& n2) \n7. Node Merge(Node n1, Node n2) \n```\n\n*My thoughts:* Wasn't feeling particularly well after this round. Although I solved the coding problem very quickly, the unexpected language-specific questions made me very nervous. I would say I fumbled around 40 percent of the theoretical questions. I have gone over hundreds of interview experiences and never saw language-specific questions in a Google technical round. This was easily my worst round. I was hoping for a Lean Hire/Hire rating for this, only because I had solved the coding question quickly but was thinking it might be even Lean No Hire. \n\n*Result:* The recruiter's call surprised me; she said the overall feedback was positive, despite a couple of concerns. Since she mentioned positive rather than mixed feedback (which is common for LH/LNH), I believe my rating was Hire. Thankfully, weightage was given to my performance in the coding question and not just the language specific questions.\n\n**Onsite Round 3:**\n\n*Problems:*\n\nQ1: \nDesign a class which will have these two methods:  \n```\nAddEvent(int timestamp, int clientId) -> adds an request/event by this clientId at this timestamp\ngetCount()  -> this will return the number of distinct client requests in the last K seconds. K was also given upfront. \n\nYou can assume you have a method which will give current time and you can use that in the getCount() method. \n```\n\n\nQ2: \nThere is a chess contest between N players. Each chess player has a distinct rank (positive integer number from 1 to N). \nWe assume that in a chess game between two players, the higher ranked player always wins. Best player would have rank 1 and worst player would have rank N. \n\nRank1 => the player wins all other players.\nRankN => The player loses against all the players \n  \nUnfortunately, we don't know the player ranks. But we know the outcome of M games in the following format:\nGiven the results of M games above, are there any players whose rank can be precisely determined? Return true is yes otherwise false. \n\n```\nExample:\nN=5 M=5\nThe result of M games:  \nPlayer #4 won #3 (read as player with id 4 won against player with id 3) \nPlayer #4 won #2\nPlayer #3 won #2\nPlayer #1 won #2\nPlayer #2 won #5\nAnswer: True  \n\nThe rank of 2 players can be determined precisely:\nplayer #2(rank is 4): they lost to players #1, #3, #4 and won against player #5;\nplayer #5(rank is 5): they lost to player #2 and we know that player #2 has already lost to #1, #3, and #4.\n```\n\n*My thoughts:* Easily my best round, was able to solve both the questions but the round was anything but smooth. Throughout the round, I struggled to understand the interviewer's accent and primarily relied on what he wrote in the shared document. Thankfully, he too acknowledged the gap in communication and gave me an additional 30 minutes to complete the coding for the second question. I was expecting a Strong Hire/Hire rating for this round.\n\n*Result:* The recruiter confirmed positive feedback with no concerns. The rating would have been SH. \n\n\n**Googlyness:**\n\nThis round was taken by a very experienced Googler.  Most of the questions felt standard and I was able to answer them well along with the follow up questions. \n\nI mostly prepared from this list by a fellow leetcoder:  https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/5963463/googlyness-frequently-asked-questions-by-55sh/. I prepared answers for all questions based on my experiences and used chatgpt to refine those answers. This round went smoothly, and I was expecting an H or SH.\n\n*Result:* The recruiter confirmed it was a very good round for me, with positive feedback and no concerns. The rating would have been SH, and she informed me I would be moving to the team matching stage.\n\n**Team Matching Round:**\n\nA week later, a team matching round was scheduled. I researched about the team a bit, brushed up on my resume and revised my notes for Googlyness round as part of preparation for this round.\n\nIn the call, the EM mostly spoke about their team and asked a bunch of questions about their work and product. I showed genuine interest and I believe this is the most important thing in this round. \n\n*Result:* Recruiter called and said it was a good match and that they will forward my packet to the Hiring Committee. \n\n**Final Result:**\n\nA week after the team matching feedback, the recruiter set up a call for compensation discussion. After a round of negotiation, I happily accepted the offer a day later!\n\n# Preparation: \n\nI used to do leetcode in my college days. So when I started looking out for job switch, to revise all the concepts quickly I completed the Neetcode 150 list.\n \nFor google targeted preparation - I solved many problems from other Google interview experiences shared on Leetcode. When I say \"I solved\",  I genuinely mean I implemented the running code locally for the problems which I thought had tricky implementation or had a concept which I was not too confident in. I believe this hands-on approach was one of the most important things that helped me a lot. Here's a small snapshot of my solutions folder to give you an idea:\n\n![Screenshot 2025-05-17 at 1.48.38 PM.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/f61be3bb-dd30-45ea-b9d4-5e085055cb8c_1747469959.932661.png)\n\n\n# Final thoughts: \n\nThe whole process took over 3 months and I learnt how to be really patient. At times, I felt like stopping Google-targeted preparation, as I had to spend significant time on LLD and system design preparation as well, which are asked in all other companies for mid-level roles. But I think my love for problem-solving kept me at it, and I made it a point to solve at least 2-3 google-kinda problems daily. Consistency and trust in the process pays off. \n\nThank you all for reading. Happy coding and good luck!",

    "content": "# Background \n- Experience: 2.5 years as a SDE\n- Education: Tier-3 college\n\n# 🧠 Online Assessment\nGot an invite for SDE-2 OA, and was able to solve 15/15 test cases on both questions. I can't share the exact problems (NDA), but the patterns were around:\n\nPrefix + Suffix handling\nSliding window with maps and constraints\n\nThen workstyle simulation and more sections for SDE2\nI received a call within a few days for onsite in office (offline) rounds at the Amazon office in Bangalore, 2 round same day and if I clear any one of them then HM round same day. I had roughly 3 weeks to prepare.\n\n# 🧰 Prep Strategy\nWith limited time, I focused heavily on:\n\nDSA: Continued solving daily on LeetCode, targeting mediums and selected hards\n\nLLD & HLD: Followed case studies and made notes from YouTube + system design primers\n\nLeadership Principles (LPs): Practiced 1-2 stories per day. \n\nMock Interviews: Did at least one mock every alternate day (coding or LP focus), I used ChatGPT to simulate mock interviews.\n\nNote : as I was already working so managing time between my work and prepration was little challenging\n# 🧪 Interview Rounds\n#### 📍 Round 1: DSA (Onsite)\nQuestions (similar):\n\nLongest Common Subsequence\nLongest Palindromic Substring\nZigzag Level Order Traversal of Binary Tree\n\n🔍 My approach: Started with recursion, moved to memoization, and then converted to bottom-up DP for LCS and palindrome problems. Solved and coded them on paper. No laptop was given to code.\n\nNo LPs were asked in this round.\n\nVerdict: Inclined\n\n✅ Felt good about this one — interviewer was engaged, gave a thumbs-up when I optimized LCS properly. One big advantage of offline interviews.\n\n#### 📍 Round 2: LLD +  LP\n\nDesign Task: IRCTC Booking System (Railway Reservation System)\n\nNot trivial. Time was limited. I couldn’t complete the entire flow but broke it down:\n\nShowed how I would model trains, stations, routes\nFocused on core booking module and conditions\n\nWrote high-level class structure + some pseudocode\n\n🎙️ LPs: Can’t recall exactly, but there were 2–3 light behavioral questions. Focus was more on LLD.\n\n💬 Interviewer said: \"You prioritized the right module and communicated clearly, that’s what we wanted.\"\nVerdict: Inclined\n\n#### 📍 Round 3: HLD + Hiring Manager\n\n🚨 This was the toughest round for me.\n\n📌 LPs First:\n\nFaced deep LP questions focused on failure handling, technical ownership, and customer impact.\nStruggled here — I wasn’t able to articulate some challenges well as interviewer was looking for more and more technical challanges and he was not able to relate tried my best to explain him but was not impressed\n\n🛠️ Design Question: Twitter with some custom requirements\n\nI was expecting caching, pub-sub etc., but midway I froze. Couldn’t cover scaling properly.\n😞 I knew I fumbled this one. But recruter told that they would take BR round.\nVerdict: Not Inclined\n# 📍 Round 4: Bar Raiser (After ~20 days!)\n\n🎙️ LPs first:\n\nInitially nervous, but managed to answer convincingly once I got into the groove.\nFocused on Ownership, Dive Deep, and Invent & Simplify.\nInterviewer nodded and asked meaningful follow-ups, which helped ease nerves.\n\nDSA\nFind Max Path Sum in Binary Tree (including negative values)\nFollow-up: Print the path as well\n\nThankfully I’d solved this exact pattern in practice a week earlier! Used recursion + backtracking + tracking global max.\n\n🎯 Had a great discussion with the interviewer. Felt really positive leaving this round.\n\nVerdict: Inclined ✅\n# 📬 Final Outcome\nWas told that overall feedback was good, but I would be offered SDE-1, not SDE-2.\n\n💸 Compensation:\nDetailed post https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/6657596/amazon-india-sde-1-25-yoe-tier-3-college-3hqv/\n\n# 🧠 Key Learnings\n#### ✅ What Helped:\nStructured revision plan (thanks to ChatGPT)\nDSA grind — especially recursion + DP patterns\nDeep LLD understanding and communicating tradeoffs clearly\nLP story prep — having different stories for all situtaions \n\n#### ❌ What Didn’t:\nDidn’t rehearse enough for HLD questions, just saw videos.  \n\n#### 📢 Final Advice\nIf you're interviewing for Amazon (especially SDE-2):\n\n🔹 Know your LPs cold — frame them like stories with challenge, action, result [STAR pattern]\n🔹 Practice system design under time pressure — even partial solutions are fine if you explain your decisions and focus on what recruter is looking for \n🔹 Nail fundamentals — recursion, backtracking, trees, sliding window, DP\n🔹 Keep your confidence even if one round feels shaky\n\nHappy to answer questions or help anyone preparing — just drop a comment here or share your linkedin or discord! 💬\n\nGood luck to everyone preparing — it’s intense, but totally worth it 🙌\n\nNote : Questions mentioned above are similar questions not the exact questions asked \n\nRadhe Radhe 🌸 ",

That said, the new company doesn't seem to offer much excitement or alignment with my interests either.\n\nBut they are offering a SDE-2 role, which is impressive again.\n\nFixed Salary: 16L -> 24.2L\nRSU: 0 -> 15,000 (USD over 3 years, 1/3rd each year).\n\nWill be missing out on joining bonus of 3L in previous company though.\n\n\nThe primary reason is compensation — I strongly feel that I’m significantly underpaid, especially compared to my friends and classmates. But again I don't want to be stuck in a loop of dissatisfaction in work. So basically a deadlock😅.\n\nAdditionally, is it a misconception that switching domains within the first 5 years of experience is easy? Personally, I’ve found it quite challenging to even get shortlisted for interviews when applying to companies in a different domain. Feel free to share your opinions😁.\n\n",

Since have applied to Amazon for summer internship before, they had my email ID.\r\n\r\nJanuary 2025 (third week) - Got the OA link (medium)\r\n\r\nFirst Question (Easy) - It was a greedy question in which you needed to count the minimum health a player needs to survive.\r\nSecond question (Medium) - Sliding window + hashmap question.\r\nAfter DSA, it had the behaviorial part.\r\n\r\nFebruary 2025 (Second week) - Got the mail saying that I passed the OA and interviews will be scheduled soon.\r\n\r\nFebruary 2025 (Third week) - First interview round ( LP+DSA)\r\n\r\nStarted with each other's introduction and then 10 mins of Leadership Principles. He asked me 2 DSA questions.\r\n\r\nFirst question - Build a data structure which can insert, search, delete and get random element in O(1) time. There was a follow up asking what if there are duplicates in the input.\r\n\r\nSecond question - Find square root of a number. I gave basic binary search answer then he followed up asking what if we want the answer with say 8 place decimal precision.\r\n\r\nNeed to tell time and space complexity of all codes. Brownie points if you explain with a dry run as well.\r\n\r\nFebruary 2025 (last week) - Got a call for the second interview at 11:30 am saying they want to schedule it that day 2 pm.\r\n\r\nSecond Round (LP+DSA) - Started just like the first one with introduction and then 10 mins of Leadership Principles. He asked 2 DSA questions.\r\n\r\nFirst question - You are given the starting and ending times for ML models. Each model used a GPU to run. 4 GPUs make up 1 CPU. Find the minimum number of CPUs needed to run all the models. Basically this problem was a variation of the minimum number of platforms question. I followed with the line sweep algorithm first then he asked what if the time intervals are given in decimals then I told him the sorting+two pointers method.\r\n\r\nSecond Question - You are given a matrix full of 'S' and 'O'. Any 'O' or cluster of 'O' that are not covered by S from all directions become 'S' as well. We have to return the final state of the matrix. Basically any 'O' and the 'O' connected to it become\r\n'S' as they are not covered, so you run a DFS for all 'o' on the edges and convert them one by one to 'S'. The rest of the 'O' after the DFS stay as 'O' only as they are surrounded by 'S'\r\n\r\nGave time and space complexity for both codes and the interview said at the end of interview that I did well (bro made me blush). Got mail\r\nfor the Bar Raised round 2 hours later scheduled for the next day.\r\n\r\nFebruary 2025 (last week) - Round 3 (Bar Raiser)\r\n\r\nInterview started with Introduction and then started the spamming of Leadership Principles.\r\n•  Tell me about a time when you worked on something outside your comfort zone.\r\n•  Tell me about a time when you got negative feedback from a higher up.\r\nAnd a lot more follow ups and questions.\r\n\r\nWe had 10-15 mins left after this rapid fire of Lps so the interviewer asked if I wanted to chat or he can ask a question.

    "content": "Hello LeetCode Community,\\n\\n**Education:** Btech in Computer Science and Engineering from Tier 1 college\\n**Years of Experience:** 4+ years\\n**Current Company:** Top MNC (non FAANG)\\n**Current Position:** SDE2\\n**Current Location:** Bengaluru, India\\n**Offer Date:** January 22, 2025\\n**Current Compensation:** \\u20B950 LPA (\\u20B936 LPA Base)\\n**LC Stats:** 673(146 E, 437 M, 90H)\\n\\nI\\'m thrilled to share my Google L4 interview experience, from application to offer acceptance. I applied for a position at Google through their careers page in the first week of November 2024.  The very next day, I received an email from a Google recruiter requesting my resume, which I promptly sent. A couple of days later, the recruiter contacted me by phone to discuss my fit for Google and inquire about my availability for a phone screen. I requested three weeks to prepare.\\n\\n**Interview Experience:**\\n\\n**Phone Screening [December 12, 2024]:**\\nInitially scheduled for December 4th, the phone screen was postponed due to interviewer unavailability. The question was a relatively straightforward design problem involving a Priority Queue or TreeSet. I solved the problem with a small hint from the interviewer. No follow-up questions were asked. I then asked a few general questions, and the interview concluded.\\n\\nWithin a couple of hours, the recruiter contacted me to inform me that the phone screen feedback was positive, and I would be moving on to the on-site (virtual) rounds.\\n\\n**Verdict: Hire**\\n\\nA few days later, a different recruiter contacted me to schedule my on-site rounds. I requested that they be scheduled in the first week of January 2025.\\n\\n**Round 1 [January 6, 2025]:**\\nI was asked a question similar to \"Evaluate Expression,\" solvable using a stack. It was a variation of a common LeetCode problem. I addressed two follow-up questions, making necessary code adjustments. I completed everything within 40 minutes, performed dry runs with several examples, and explained the time and space complexities. The interviewer seemed pleased.\\n\\nThe following day, the recruiter informed me that the feedback was extremely positive.\\n\\n**Verdict: Strong Hire**\\n\\n**Round 2 [January 7, 2025]:**\\nThis round focused on a graph problem, a variant of Dijkstra\\'s algorithm. I coded the solution in 15 minutes, correcting a small bug pointed out by the interviewer. I was then asked a follow-up question, a modification of the initial problem. I coded the solution, performed a dry run, and explained the time and space complexities. The interviewer appeared satisfied.\\n\\nThe next day, the recruiter contacted me again, stating that the feedback was very good.\\n\\n**Verdict: Strong Hire**\\n\\n**Round 3 [January 8, 2025]:**\\nThis was a rather unusual geometry question (I couldn\\'t find a similar one on LeetCode). I solved it using BFS and explained the time and space complexities. While functional, the solution was suboptimal. The interviewer asked me to optimize it, and I proposed a DP solution, which was also suboptimal. With only 10 minutes remaining, the interviewer provided a hint, which enabled me to quickly devise and code the optimal solution. (I ran out of time; the interview lasted approximately 50 minutes.)\\n\\nThe following day, the recruiter contacted me, saying the feedback was mixed.\\n\\n**Verdict: Lean Hire**\\n\\n**Googleyness & Leadership (G&L) Round [January 10, 2025]:**\\nThis round was quite relaxed. I felt over-prepared. The interviewer asked a few situational questions, after which I had the opportunity to ask general questions about Google\\'s culture. The interview concluded within 20-25 minutes.\\n\\n**Verdict: Strong Hire**\\n\\n**January 13, 2025:** The recruiter called to explain that my on-site feedback was positive and that I would be moving on to team matching.\\n\\n**January 15, 2025:** I was contacted about a potential team match and asked about my availability for the following day.\\n\\n**Team Match [January 16, 2025]:**\\nI had a team match with a Google Cloud team based in Hyderabad. The Hiring Manager (HM) described the team, their work, and their tech stack. He asked me about my current work. I liked the work; the product seemed interesting, and Hyderabad is my preferred location. I was happy with the team.\\n\\n**January 17, 2025:** The recruiter called to inform me that the HM wanted to proceed with me for the position. I confirmed my interest in the team. The recruiter then requested additional details to prepare the offer packet for the Hiring Committee (HC).\\n\\n**January 21, 2025:** The recruiter called to inform me that the HC had approved my packet, and we had a preliminary compensation discussion.\\n\\n**January 22, 2025:** We had the final compensation discussion. After a brief negotiation, we finalized the offer, and the recruiter released the offer letter, which I signed the same day.",

Here’s my experience of the entire process.\r\n#### Round 1: Online Assessment\r\n\r\nThe online assessment was conducted on the Codejudge platform and consisted of 3 DSA questions to be solved in 90 minutes. This round was held on campus.\r\n\r\nQuestions asked:\r\n1. [Trapping Rain Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/description/)\r\n2. [An easier variation of N Queens](https://leetcode.com/problems/n-queens/description/)\r\n3. A 2D dynamic programming string question similar to [Interleaving Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/interleaving-string/description/) and [Edit Distance](https://leetcode.com/problems/edit-distance/description/).\r\n\r\nI was able to solve all three questions and got shortlisted for the next round.\r\n\r\n#### Round 2: DSA Interview\r\n\r\nThis round lasted 1 hour and involved a backtracking + combinations question. Unfortunately, I don’t remember the exact problem since I hadn’t come across a similar one on LeetCode before. The interviewer seemed satisfied with my approach.\r\n\r\n#### Round 3: Tech Interview (LLD)\r\n\r\nI was given a Low-Level Design (LLD) problem for an Online Stock Brokerage System. The focus was mainly on implementing a feature to fetch the Top N stocks traded in the last 1 hour (trending stocks).\r\n\r\n- Discussed requirements in detail.\r\n- Explored trade-offs between different data structures for tracking top stocks.\r\n- Implemented the solution and made changes based on the interviewer's suggestions.\r\n\r\nThe interviewer was satisfied with the final approach. This round also lasted 1 hour.\r\n\r\n#### Final Result\r\n\r\nAfter two weeks, I received a call from HR confirming my selection! 🎉\r\n\r\nFind the compensation details here - [https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/6513864/zeta-sde1-on-campus-feb-2025-offer-by-an-265l/](https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/6513864/zeta-sde1-on-campus-feb-2025-offer-by-an-265l/)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Since I'm joining in April, my RSUs won’t vest for a year, but i get variable payment from my prev company :-).One reason I accepted the offer without much negotiation is that I got selected within just a month of seriously applying. The funny part is, I actually got selected for Walmart twice! But by the time the second recruiter reached out, I had already received the first offer, so I only had one chance to negotiate.Would love to hear your thoughts, especially from Walmartians!\r\n\r\n",

The recruiter had contacted me post that all asked all the documents of my current salary slip etc.\r\n\r\nHe then proposed numbers in an unofficial offer letter with very low base based on my current CTC. I asked for more base and CTC. This happened 2 weeks ago and since then I have been waiting for any updates from their side, I contacted my HR, but he is not giving me any updates and keep telling that he is been busy. The procees seems so slow to me.\r\n\r\nIs there any chance that they are not considering me beacuse I asked for more numbers as I am starting to think that he is in contact with me just so that he can buy some time and interview other candidates in the mean time?\r\n\r\nAny experience or suggestion will be appreciated.

    "content": "I recently interviewed with Google for L3 role and got the offer. As I found Leetcode's community very helpful while I was preparing, I thought of giving back to it by writing this.\n\nI have around 1.5 years of experience in the industry.\n\n# **Application:**\nI applied for 3 roles with referral around mid of September 2024. Out of which 2 applications got rejected and I got a call back for one of the applications around mid of November 2024. My LC count was around 450 when 2 of my applications got rejected. I was solving problems on LC to get my touch back on DSA and got the count around 550 in November 2024. I do believe adding a good LC or any coding profile link in your resume will get you a call as Google's interviews for L3 and L4 are purely based on DSA.\n\n# HR call:\nThe recruiter reached out to me via mail and asked for my updated CV. Followed by a short call on Gmeet, explaining the Google's interview process. I was asked some basic questions on DSA and how do I rate myself on DSA out of 10. I was asked my coding language preference. I used Java in all my coding rounds. Just bragged for some 15 minutes and moved forward to scheduling initial phone screen. My recruiter gave me 3 weeks to brush up on DSA and scheduled the phone screen on early December 2024.\n\n# Phone Screen:\nThe interviewer was from Hyderabad, India office. He greeted me and introduced himself. He said he's also a Noogler (New to Google) and asked me to introduce myself. I kept my introduction very brief to save as much of time as possible to solve the problems.\n\n**First problem:**\nhttps://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-area-rectangle/description/\n**Follow up:**\nhttps://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-area-rectangle-ii/description/\n\nInstead of minimum area, I was asked to return largest area possible in both the problems.\n\nI explained the optimal approach for first problem and coded the solution within 10 minutes. Then I was asked to come up with the approach for the follow up. He didn't want me to code it. I explained the optimal approach for follow up as well. Whole interview got wrapped up within 25 minutes.\n\nI got the feedback from my recruiter very next day. I was told the feedback was very positive and we are moving to onsite interviews. Onsite has 4 interviews, out of which 3 interviews are DSA based and 1 interview is Googlyness (Behavioral). I wanted to get done with all my interviews within new year, but due to vacation season, we were not able to schedule the interviews till new year. I got my interviews scheduled around mid of January 2025.\n\n# Onsite 1:\n\nThe interviewer was from Bangalore, India office. He introduced himself and asked for my introduction. He was very clear that he will give me only 30 mins to solve the problems as he wanted 5 mins for introduction and 10 mins for any questions to ask him.\n\n**First problem:**\nGiven an english paragraph and an integer \"width\", return minimum number of lines we need to print the paragraph. I was not given any example IO and was expected to come up with my own. I asked some clarifying questions like whether a word could break from a line or not. He said the word could break. Then I came up with below example and clarified if my output was correct.\n\n```\nparagraph: \"I'm giving Google interview for L3 role\"\nwidth: 9\n\noutput: 5\n```\n\nI explained the brute force and also the optimal approach. He asked me to code both the solutions. I coded the same.\n\n**First follow up:**\nNow the words should not break from a line. I clarified one possible edge case like what if there is any word in the paragraph which has more letters than the given width. He said I can assume that the width is always equal or greater than the longest word in the paragraph. I took the same example and clarified the output. Also do we need to print the space character if it's the first character of the line. He said if any line starts with a space, we need to ignore the space.\n\n```\nparagraph: \"I'm giving Google interview for L3 role\"\nwidth: 9\n\noutput: 6\n```\n\nI explained the optimal approach and coded the same. He asked me if we could optimize this somewhere. I know there's no possible optimization on time as I was very sure that my approach was in the best BigO possible for this problem. I found an area to optimize on space, optimized the same by modifying the code.\n\n**Second follow up:**\nhttps://leetcode.com/discuss/post/1423422/google-phone-screen-by-sharmapriyanka269-ul7w/\n\nHe explained me the problem verbally and gave the example IO for this problem. We had only 2 mins left from the 30mins problem solving window. The moment he pasted the example IO, binary search striked to my mind and I explained the same. He nodded, closed the codepad, and asked me if I have any questions for him. I asked him whether my binary search approach was correct and optimal, he said YES :)\n\n# Onsite 2: (Googlyness)\n\nThe interviewer was from Europe. I expected some behavioral questions, but all the questions were work related. Some of the questions are,\n\n1) Tell me about a time where your proposed solution for a problem was not agreed by your manager.\n2) Tell me about a time where you had to work with a new team and how your contributions to the new team added value to the customer.\n3) How would you react if you're about to join a new team and all the members in the team are way more senior and experienced than you ?\n4) Tell me about a time where your proposed solution had some problems and your senior pointed it out.\n5) Did you start implementing the feature for the proposed solution that had a problem (Follow up in 4th question).\n\nI forgot other couple of questions. For all the negative scenario, I explained in a way that I had some alternative solution that would work. I didn't prepare much as I was expecting behavioral questions like conflict in team, etc. But then I somehow got away and managed to satisfy the interviewer.\n\n# Onsite 3:\n\nThe interviewer was from US. She greeted me with a smiling face and talked about herself and her team. She talked to me for some 3 minutes, mentioning that we would have an icebreaker session.\n\n**First problem:**\nGiven an array of integers, find the Longest Increasing Subsequence with difference between adjacent elements as 1.\n\nExplained both O(n^2) and O(n) and coded the optimal one.\n\n**First follow up:**\nGiven an array of integers, find the Longest Increasing Subsequence with difference between adjacent elements atmost k. k is given.\n\nExplained the O(nk) approach. She asked whether this could be optimized. I talked about segment tree and explained the approach. When I took the white paper to draw the segment tree to explain it in a better way, she stopped me right away and asked me to implement O(nk), saying she just wanted to know whether I could optimize it using a segment tree and that she wasn't going to ask me to implement the segment tree for the sake of this interview, which was only 45 minutes long. I coded the O(nk) solution.\n\n**Second follow up:**\nSame as first problem, but instead of returning just LIS as an integer, need to return the LIS list, which contains the indices of the elements in LIS.\n\nExplained the optimal solution and coded the same. I finished coding all 3 problems exactly on 45th minute of the interview. She ended the interview officially and was talking with me for some 20 minutes. She was sorry for extending this to another 20 minutes as she wanted to give me a chance to talk to her about her experience and Google. **Such good interviewers deserve a spot bonus !!**\n\n# Onsite 4:\nThe interviewer was from US. She jumped into the problem statement directly. \nhttps://leetcode.com/discuss/post/4263604/google-onsite-round-1-by-adityakan750-niib/\n\nSame problem was divided into two parts.\n\n**First problem:**\nDon't need to care about the colors of the houses.\n\n**First follow up:**\nHandle with the colors of the houses.\n\nExplained the optimal approach and coded the same for both the parts. The follow up part was more like a design problem, I created a class for house and handled the colors. Interviewer mentioned that I could choose the output format as I wish.\n\n# Feedback Call:\nI got the feedback after 3 days from my last onsite round. Generally it would take atleast a week to get feedback, but my interviews were cancelled and got rescheduled 4 times due to interviewer's unavailability. These reschedules made the process a bit longer. I think because of this, my recruiter got the feedback for the interviews that happened early.\n\nI was told that my feedback is very strong, especially in all my DSA rounds. Then I got a team fit call scheduled the very next day.\n\n# TeamFit Call:\nThis went more like a discussion. The manager introduced himself and explained about the work and the team. I was asked about the techs I worked on and some questions.\n\n1) Let's say you're about to work on new teckstack. Will you be able to ramp up much faster ? Will you be able to learn as well as work on those techs parallely ?\n2) Talk about any interesting or challenging feature you've worked on.\n3) Why are you leaving your org and why do you want to join Google ?\n4) You have 1.5 yoe and if you continue with your org, you will get a promotion in next 6 months. But if you join Google as an L3, it might take another 1.5 years for a promotion. What do you think about this ?\n\n# Comp Discussion and Offer\nI got a call from my recruiter after 3 days from my teamfit call to check my availability for the compensation discussion. I was not asked about my current compensation. I didn't give any other interviews and had no offers with me. I didn't negotiate and accepted the offer as the initial numbers were itself great. Offer got rolled out on the same day!\n\n[Compensation Details](https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/6541970/google-l3-swe-2-india-by-rvishwaa-51dm/)\n\n# Preparation:\nI'm kind of good at problem solving from my college days, as I used to  give contest on Codeforces and Codechef. I didn't do much LC on my college days. I started grinding LC only after I decided to give it a try for Google. \n\nCP is not necessary to crack Google as all the problems I was asked were LC medium, medium-hard type of problems. But then CP experience will come handy in interviews as it widen our thought process in a large scale and we will be aware of the value of every minute that goes past in a contest. Contest are again kind of similar to interview setup. But then you gotta explain your thoughts and think out loud in an interview. I used to take DSA sessions to my juniors when I was in college. I think this helped me a lot, to put my thoughts into words and explain it to others in a way they could understand easily.\n\nTry to give contest in LC. While solving, try explaing the solution to yourself. Also, practice to code your solutions on Google Docs.",

During my job search, I had interviewed with HP Inc. for a position that was on hold at the time. I informed the HP recruiter that I was joining another company.\n\nHowever, yesterday the HP recruiter contacted me and said my interview feedback was excellent. They offered me the position without any further interviews.  I told them I had already joined another company and would have to serve a 90-day notice period. They agreed to this.We discussed salary, they initially said the previously discussed amount was fine.Then I asked if they could increase it, and they offered an additional 2 lakhs.\nso My current salary at the service-based company is 4 lakhs less than what HP has offered.\n\nNow I'm in a dilemma. Should I consider this offer? If so, should i negotiate much more on salary?because I feel I might be underpaid according to the market rate.\n\nWhat are the potential negative consequences of serving a 90-day notice period after just one month at the company?\n\n",

After a week I got a mail that I am shortlisted for the interviews.\\n\\n**Round 1 : Machine Coding(90 mins)**\\n\\nI was given a document which had the machine coding question for which I had to do the implmentation on my local machine. The question was to implement a phonebook. A set of requirements was given and they had to be mandatorily implemented. Another set of bonus requirements was also given. If time is left then you can attempt these also.\\nWhile coding, basic OOPs principles have to be implemented as well as suitable design patterns. The code should be modular and extensible.\\n\\n**Round 2 : Machine Coding Evaluation(30 mins)**\\nThis round happened on the same day as the first round. In this round we had to explain the code that we had submitted in the first round.\\n\\n**Round 3 : PS-DS Round(1 hr)**\\nThis round happened after a week from the second round. Since my LWD was only a few days away the next three rounds were scheduled within a span of 2 days.\\nTwo questions were given : \\n1. Given an integer array, print the count of subarrays which had atmost k distinct elements. \\n2. Given a number, find the minimum no of operations done to reduce the number to zero. An operation is defined as subtracting one of the digits from the number.\\n\\nSince I solved both the questions pretty fast, I was given an extension to the second problem in which I had to print all the operations done.\\n\\n**Round 4 : System Design(1 hr)**\\nThis round was mainly focussed on high-level design. I was asked to provie the design for an UrbanClap like system. Database schema design, API design and high-level design was expected from this exercise.\\n\\n**Round 5 : HM Round(1 hr)**\\nThis round was mostly technical with the last 15 mins focussing on basic behavioural questions. Deep-dive in past projects as well as discussion on design choices.\\n\\n**Verdict : Selected**\\nI got the offer letter after a week and have accepted the offer.\\n\\n**Compensation details :**\\nhttps://leetcode.com/discuss/compensation/6160367/Flipkart-or-SDE-2",

    "content": "Position: SMTS\\nYOE: 5+\\n\\nI got a referral for an opening back in Oct and was invited for the Hackerrank OA.\\n\\n**Round 1: Hacker rank OA (Nov 5)**\\nHonestly I don\\'t remember the questions since I took it more than 2 months back. But both problems were of medium-hard difficulty. I solved both of them with all the test cases passing.\\n\\nI got a call from the recruiter same day after the OA, asking about my work experience, current TC and expected TC. She mentioned that she will forward my profile to the HM and get back in couple of days. She never got back and I tried reaching out to her as well after a week but to no avail. Probably the opening got filled.\\nOn 20th Nov, I got an email from a different recruiter about a hiring drive on Nov 29 (Fri) for a different opening and I agreed to participate. Probably I was added in their candidate pool or something once I cleared the OA and they might invite candidates from the pool for interviews much later as well.\\n\\n**Round 2: Coding (Nov 29)**\\nThe interviewer invited me on Hackerrank and there were 2 questions to be solved. We would then run the solutions against all the available testcases on Hackerrank.\\n```\\nFirst question: There are 3 kinds of queries on a stream of numbers:\\n(1, X) - Add X in your list of numbers\\n(2, X) - Add X to all the existing numbers\\n(3)    - Print the min number so far and remove it from the list\\n\\nFor e.g.\\n(1, 3) - current list = [3]\\n(1, 5) - current list = [3, 5]\\n(2, 10) - add 10 to all the existing numbers, list becomes [13, 15]\\n(1, 12) - current list = [12, 13, 15]\\n(3)  - print the minimum number and remove it from the list: 12\\n\\nSecond question: A variation of coin change problem\\n```\\n\\nI was able to solve both the problems and got all test cases passing.\\n\\n**Round 3: Coding (Nov 29)**\\n``` \\nGiven a large number as string (size upto 10^5). Find count of subsequences which are divisible by 4. \\nSince the count could be a large number, return the count module 10^9 + 7.\\n```\\nI was expected to write the code on an editor. I was stuck initially for a very long time and started feeling frustrated too. but the interviewer was very helpful. The hint around what makes a number divisible by 4 really helped me and I was able to come up with a solution and code it. We ran the code for few test cases and there were couple of bugs in my code but we debugged it together and got a fully working code. Definitely not my best round but was able to cope and get over the line somehow.\\n\\n**Round 4: System Design (Nov 29)**\\n1. Discussion on how to tackle the celebrity problem on Twitter (or any social media tbf)\\n2. Discussion on incremental, blue-green rollout/deployment strategy and how we can leverage it to gracefully rollout few features in a mobile app.\\n\\nI had read about the celebrity problem and hence was able to talk around it and discuss feasible solutions. For #2, I guess my work experience helped me since we practice a lot of rollout/deployment strategies at my current workplace. This round went well overall.\\n\\n**Round 5: Hiring Manager (Nov 29)**\\nStandard behavioral questions and discussion around his team and their work. Typical HM round.\\n\\nOn Dec 4, the recruiter asked me for a discussion with the LMTS (lead) of the team I was interviewing for. They named it the `fitment round`. It was a decent discussion I feel around my past work, my areas of interest and why I am looking for a change.\\n\\nFor more than a week there was no update and I was not very hopeful about making it. I tried reaching out to the recruiter but couldn\\'t get to him. I got a call from the recruiter on Dec 13. He mentioned that 2-3 candidates cleared the interviews and they went ahead with the best candidate (which obviously wasn\\'t me :). He offered me a different opening as well and in case I was interested, he would connect me directly to the HM of that other opening. But that role (and its JD) didn\\'t excite me so I politely declined. Obviously at this point I considered the salesforce chapter closed.\\n\\nTo my surprise, the recruiter reached out again on Dec 30 and mentioned that there has been one more opening in the same team I interviewed for and they would like to extend me an offer :). The offer negotiation process took couple of weeks and I finally got my offer letter rolled this week. Quite a long process but all is well that ends well.\\n\\n**My main learning from this was that very few things in this whole process are in your control. You can give your best in the interviews (even clear them) and you might not still get an offer. So just do your part and leave the rest to destiny :)**\\n\\n**Compensation details:** https://leetcode.com/discuss/compensation/6297434/Salesforce-or-SMTS-or-Offer\\n\\nI had read a lot of interview experiences during my preparation so this is me giving back to the awesome leetcode community.

The first round was then scheduled for the very next day.\\n\\n**Round 1 (DSA and Java):**\\nThere were two DSA questions in this round. One was https://leetcode.com/problems/task-scheduler-ii/description/ and the other was to implement pow(a, b) using Binary Exponentiation.\\n\\nAfter that, there were questions on Java covering topics like boxing, ORM, Java Streams (finding the sum of squares of even numbers), Runnable and Callable interfaces, and thread states and a couple more questions on Concurrency and multi threading related to ExecutorService and CompletableFuture.\\n\\nThere were also a few questions based on my resume, including Reactive Programming and backpressure, along with some basic discussion on Kubernetes.\\n\\n**Round 2 (LLD):**\\nThe problem statement was to design an interface for submitting and managing workflows that can run tasks either sequentially or in parallel, with a provision for passing data between workflows. There was an in-depth discussion on the class diagram and design patterns, followed by coding a few interfaces, classes, and key methods.\\n\\nThis went on for about 40-45 minutes, after which the focus shifted to topics from my resume. Most of the questions from this point were on Kafka\\u2019s internals (log replication, leader election, durability, partitions, consumer groups) and its use cases.\\n\\n**Round 3 (Hiring Manager):**\\nThe discussion started with the tech stack used at my organization and an overview of the business problem we were solving. This was followed by a deep dive into a caching solution mentioned in my resume, covering general caching requirements and pseudo-code implementations for eviction policies like LRU, LFU, and FIFO. I was also asked how I would implement TTL in a cache.\\n\\nThere were a few follow-up questions on topics like CP subsystem, the CAP theorem, and managing a distributed cache across multiple pods using a consensus algorithm.\\n\\nTowards the end, there were general and behavioral questions on handling bugs and production issues resolution, stakeholder and deadline management, and what keeps me motivated.\\n\\n**Round 4 (HR):**\\nThe discussion included usual HR questions like my strengths, a time when I dealt with a tough situation, and how I handle conflicts. After that, the HR explained the benefits and perks at Walmart and concluded by providing a verbal offer.\\n\\nOverall the interviewers were understanding and interactive, and all four rounds were conducted with a gap of about two days between each.\\nI got the offer letter five days after receiving the verbal confirmation, which I accepted.\\n\\nOffer details: https://leetcode.com/discuss/compensation/6492167/Walmart-or-Software-Engineer-3-or-Bengaluru",

    "content": "Hello LeetCode Community,\\n\\n\\nI\\'m happy to share my Google L4/SWE-III interview experience,timelines and few preparation strategies.\\n\\n\\n**Background:**\\nGraduate from a Tier 1 College\\n4+ years of experience in a Tier 1 Product Based Company (Non FAANG)\\n679 (147 Easy, 422 Medium, 110 Hard) problems solved on leetcode.\\n**Previous Comp** : 40L(31L Base + 12% bonus + RSU\\'s)\\n\\n\\n**Initial Call**\\nI was reached out by a Google Recruiter on LinkedIn during the end of August 2024. As I was not very much confident, I asked for a month of preparation (Yes you can ask for time if you are not ready). To get started with, my recruiter has shared me some preparation material and set up my phone screening round.\\n\\n\\n**Preparation Phase**\\nI started doing one question a day on Leetcode starting jan 2024 as a new year resolution. I was moderately regular with this and solved about 150 problems till this point. Few on my own, few looking at solutions. This exercise really helped me warm up and definitely gave me a head start but I know this isn\\'t gonna suffice from now. During this month I have dedicatedly solved every problem of Strivers SDE Sheet topic by topic, watched his videos. Last one week, I stooped solving new questions and just revised the questions I already did from this sheet, especially focusing on the ones that i could not do on my own the very first time.\\n\\n\\n**Phone Screening Round [30-09-2024]**\\nI was asked a typical sliding window based question and a couple of follow ups which were of medium complexity. I explained the appraoch to the interview, coded it, optimised it(O(2N) -> O(N)), did the dry run for 2 examples, one where the optimisation would help reduce the complexity. I was able to finish all this in less than 30 min, interviewer seemed happy and I was confident on my solution.\\n\\n\\nI did not hear back from my recruiter for about a month even after couple of follow up mails from my end. During this time, I had other interviews lined up, so i had to manage my coding preparation along with LLD and HLD. I continued doing 5-7 medium/hard problems a day during this time as well.\\n\\n\\n**Onsite Interviews:**\\n\\n\\n**Coding Round 1[13/11/2024]**\\n\\n\\nI was asked a geometry based question(LeetCode Medium, Google Tagged). I explained the approach, coded it up and then the interviewer asked me few C++ related questions. I had answered them. He asked one small follow up, coded up that as well. Interview was done in 30 mins.\\n\\n\\n**Coding Round 2[14/11/2024]**\\n\\n\\nIn this round I was asked to design a class and a couple of methods for RLE. I coded them up and explained the complexity O(N). Then the interviewer asked me if i could do any better. Then I came up with a binary search approach and coded that as well. We were almost running out of time and then interviewer asked me a followup and mentioned to just explain the approach and not required to code it. I explained him as it is an extention of the Binary search solution I had written. He was happy with the approach.\\n\\n\\n**Coding Round 3[15/11/2024]**\\n\\n\\nI was asked a LeetCode Hard in this round, I have already solved a similar question earlier, so I was already familar with the optimised approach. I had explained the brute force approach to the interviewer first and then moved on to explaining the optimal solution. He asked me to code the optimal approach. Coded it up and did the dry run. He then asked me my first follow up - create some test cases for this method, I have come up with some happy scenarios and some edge cases as well. Then my second follow up was on scaling this method I had created for a very large use case. This is something that i was not expecting and was not prepared for. I came up with few solutions but interviewer was not very happy with them and then later explained me what he was expecting. Over all, this round went okay, but not as good as the other 2.\\n\\n\\n**Googlyness [18/11/2024]**\\n\\n\\nI had a weekend to prepare for this round. Went through some youtube videos. Went through some leetcode posts. I prepared for few questions like, what is the most critical project I worked on, challenging aspects of it and put them in STAR format. This round was taken by one of the managers. He asked me some standard questions and noted down my answers. Few of them had followups too. All in all, it went good.\\n\\n\\nMy recruiter did not reach out to me for a week after this. I had couple of other offers so I emailed to my recruiter to let me know the verdict as I have to plan accordingly. Then I recieved a call saying feedback was positive and I will be moved to the team match phase.\\n\\n\\nIn the coming week, I had 2 team match calls. I was interested in the second team and luckily the manager was also interested, so my recruiter moved on and created a packet for me to submit to the Hiring Committe.\\n\\n\\nAfter a week, I heard from my recruiter saying the Hiring Committe has put my packet on hold due to some gaps in my technical rounds. She did not mention which round or what were the gaps and neither was i told the hire signals for my rounds even after requesting. So, my recruiter arranged for 2 more additional rounds.\\n\\n\\nThis time, for preparation I had solved about 50-70 recently asked Google Tagged questions in leetcode.\\n\\n\\n**Additional Round 1[18/12/2024]**\\n\\n\\nIn this round I was asked a Graph based question. It could be solved with BFS or DFS, similar to Leetcode-200. I explained him both the approaches along with the time complexities. Coded up the DFS one.\\nThen he moved on to a different question similar to LeetCode-127 . I explained him the approach and started coding it. Then he stopped me and asked if I knew how to solve this using A*. I said I am not familar with A* algorithm, he then explained me what A* is and asked me to go through it in free time. Then he gave a follow up to the original problem , I gave him a solution with O(N^2). He asked me if i could come up with a better solution. We had talked about few other approaches and finalised on one and he asked me to just do a dry run of this and I did.\\n\\n\\n**Additional Round 2[18/12/2024]**\\n\\n\\nIn this round I was asked a question realed to modified CPU Scheduling problem. I had given a brute force solution, interviewer aksed me to optimise it. It took me a while to come up with the optimal solution.Then I coded it up and did the dry run. Then we moved on to the next question which is kind of an extension to the original question. The trick was to map it to the Binary Search on Answers kind of questions. I had coded it up and explained the time complexity. Interviewer seemed happy.\\n\\n\\nAs it was holiday season I did not hear back from my recruiter for a long long time. I heard back on 07-01-2025 that Hiring Committe has approved my packet for L4 but the position for the team I had earlier been matched with has been closed. So my recruiter put me in the team match phase again.\\n\\n\\nI had 2 team match rounds in the next 3 weeks and I finally I was matched with the second team(Google Ads).\\n\\n\\n**Compensation Discussion**\\n\\n\\nTwo days after my team was finalised, my recruiter has called me for the compensation discussion. I was given 2 options:\\n\\n\\n**Option 1** : 35l base + 121K GSU + 15% bonus + standard google perks\\n**Option 2** : 37.6l base + 6l Joining Bonus +101K GSU + 15% bonus + standard google perks\\n\\n\\nI was leaning towards option 2 as I wanted more Joining Bonus. I tried to negotiate further. The next day I was given a different option:\\n\\n\\n**Option 3** : 37.6l base + 8l joining bonus + 98k GSU + 15% bonus + perks\\n\\n\\nI was good with this option and I have recevied my offer on the same day.\\n\\n\\n**Offer Date - 31-01-2025**\\n\\n\\n**Final Thoughts**\\nInterviewing with google is going to take a while and all we can do is nothing but be very very patient and stay focused! Happy Coding!!",

All testcases were passing in both problems. Some scenarios and questions for tech decisions, and lot\\'s of behavioral kinda questions.\\n\\n\\n**Round 1: DSA** (Last Week of Oct 2024)\\n1. You have given `2n + 1` numbers. Each number has his pair except one number. \\nEvery pair numbers are adjacent. You need to find that number who does not have his pair.\\n\\n2. You are given a binary tree.\\n\\ta. You need to remove leaf node one by one and print the leaf nodes one by one. You can remove leaf node in any order.\\n\\tb. Remove a leaf node and after removing that node if it\\'s parent became leaf node remove that node first and so on..\\n\\tc. Remove all leaf node first than remove all new leaf node and so on.\\n\\nI had optimal solution in all cases. Binary search in 1; DFS code for 2a, same works for 2b as well and DFS for 2c as well but slightly different with maintaing current level and using `vector<vector<int>>` for return type.\\n\\nTalked to interviewer for couple of mins and then dropped off.\\n\\n**Round 2: LLD** (Last Week of Oct 2024)\\nLeadership principles - went amazing\\n\\nI had network issue in this round, lost around 5 mins. \\n\\nI was asked to implement Amazon Locker. It\\'s a service where users can choose a locker in building full of lockers and get their parcel delivered there. They get an OTP to access that locker. If they don\\'t pick up their item in 7 days, item is returned and locker should be vacated. System should know which lockers are available to be booked, and if items are not picked locker should become available again. User can pick any locker from available lockers in nearby location.\\n\\nI implemented almost all the required functionalities with modular code, but was unable to finish the 7 days thing. I also overcomplicated the data structures a bit, but interviewer asked me why I needed it and I was quickly able to see that we actually can do something much simpler. We had verbal discussion on the 7 day expire policy and idea was LGTM according to interviewer.\\n\\nTalked about the \"Just Walk Out\" concept difficulties and their solutions for some time with the interviewer.\\n\\n**Round 3: HLD/HM** (2nd Week of Nov 2024)\\nLeadership principles - went amazing\\n\\nIn this round, we were running out of time and got less than 35 mins for whole design portion.\\n\\nClarified Problem: You have a huge area of around 10 mil km\\xB2. You have sensors in every 10 km\\xB2 that send you tempareture data. Design a system to show current temprature and also supports to query past tempratures. \\n\\nI listed all the functional and non-functional requirements, did QPS and storage estimates. My whole design was based on Amazon tech. There were a LOT of cross questions like push vs pull model, why we need a particular component etc and I was not able give good answer for two. I was also not able to add a SQL database I wanted for recent data. It was discussed verbally and I also added how we can add some ML and show future predictions etc. \\n\\nTalked to interviewer for couple of mins about the team and what they do and then dropped off.\\n\\n**Round 4: Bar raiser** (3rd Week of Nov 2024)\\nLeadership principles: went pretty good\\n\\nInterviewer started with 2 sum in an unsorted array, I quickly gave 3 ideas for that, `O(n * n)`, `O(n * log(n))` and `O(n)`. He didn\\'t ask me to implement any of those.\\n\\nFollowup: Assume that you already have a function `vector<vector<int>> getPairs(vector<int> arr, int target)` which returns pairs that sum upto ```target``` in array `arr`. Write a code for `vector<vector<int>> getKDimensions(int k, vector<int> arr, int target)` where you pick  `k` distinct indices from `arr` that sum upto `target`. You must use the `getPairs` function above.\\n\\nThis one had a short recursive code with exponential time complexity - there\\'s no way to avoid that. I didn\\'t exactly remember the function signature for `vector insert()`, interviewer was okay with it and code was LGTM according to interviewer. I was also not sure about time complexity as the code was slightly complicated to analyse the time complexity and I was a bit lazy to think too much - I told him what & why I thought and that I might be off by a factor of `n`. He said \"okay that\\'s fine\" didn\\'t question it further.\\n\\nTalked to interviewer for ~10 mins about their old days in tech as they were very experienced.\\n\\n\\n**Compensation** (1st Week of Dec 2024)\\nhttps://leetcode.com/discuss/compensation/6123742/Amazon-SDE-II-India",

    "content": "### How I got shortlisted\nApple hires very specifically for teams and filters by candidates who have highly relevant experience. An initial resume screen is performed by the recruiters and then final shorlist is done by Managers who look for good overlap in technical skills of the candidate and skills required for the role.\nSo it's really important to tailor the resume to the Job description for Apple.\n\nApplied to about 10+ roles on the Apple Careers site, whose description overlapped with my experience.\n\n---\n\n### Recruiter Call\nAbout a month later, a recruiter reached out regarding one of the roles. This was for a Full Stack Engineer on an internal ML platform.\nShared my experience and was able to move ahead for a Hiring Manager Round.\n\n---\n\n### Hiring Manager\nA very candid discussion on why I chose the role, my relevant experience, why I would like to join, where I see myself, and why I chose Apple.\nThe conversation was very positive, and I knew I was moving to the next round\n\n\n---\n\n\nTechnical rounds have a general similarity.\nThe problems were highly vague. They required me to ask the right questions to complete the problem definition and then start working on it.\nThey were very keen on clear communication and discussions.\n\n\n### Technical Phone Screen\n**Problem 1:** A vote counter\nStarted with this vague problem statement and narrowed it down to this -\nBuild a class to read millions of votes from a ballot list and perform rank-based vote counting. Had to handle batching to solve for memory usage.\n\n**Problem 2:** Given a Binary tree of 0's and 1's where the left node is the same as the parent and the right node is opposite to the parent, determine the value of the n'th node at l'th level.\nI sketched out a sample tree and then proceeded to use recursion to arrive at the solution.\n\n\n### Onsite - 5 rounds\n\n##### Coding 1\n**Problem:** Given a set of characters, determine all English words that can be created.\nStarted the discussion on determining the inputs and outputs, the structure of the dictionary to validate against.\nBuilt a trie with the dictionary list and tested every permutation of the characters.\nOptimised it in a second approach by generating a HashSet for every anagram in the dictionary and checking against characters.\n\n\n##### System Design\nThis was not a generic design round at all.\nThe interviewer was a very experienced person who had worked with Apple for over 10 years.\nThe round focused primarily on my experience. He picked each of my experiences and we discussed very deeply about my entire task. Why I picked it, what I did (sketched multiple diagrams for each question), how I measured performance, what I would do differently today.\n\n\n##### Behavioral\nThis round was with a senior manager.\n**Question:** Given the values of Apple, such as Deep expertise and Drive for Excellence, how have you showcased these in your career?\nI started picking examples from my first job to my last job, highlighting the different lessons I had learnt - technical, cultural, and leadership.\n\nSome key lessons I highlighted were -\n- Keeping it simple (KISS).\n- Don't jump to solutioning too soon.\n- Respect everyone's expertise.\n- Resolving conflicts.\n- Motivating team members.\n\n\n##### Coding 2\n**Problem 1: **Given a dataset, sample n items while maintaining the original probability distribution.\nVery straightforward problem, the solution was to maintain the original counts and use random to sample.\n\n\n**Problem 2: **Create a React component that can display 1M records.\nThe problem required slicing the data and displaying only records that would fit within the scroll section.\nThis is a classic React interview problem.\nPractice Resource : https://www.greatfrontend.com/interviews/dashboard\nHad practiced questions from here which made this really easy to solve.\n\n\n##### Coding 3\nDiscussed my expertise in React. Then the interviewer drew a basic input UI and asked me to implement it.\nI showcased skills such as breaking down the UI into components, creating a higher order component, using UseEffect, UseMemo, and UseRef for functionality.\n\n---\n\n\nMailed the recruiter for feedback as I had just cleared Amazon and had made a decision soon.\nAfter continuous follow-up for 4 days got positive feedback.\nTook another 2 days for the verbal offer and another 4 days for the written offer.\n\nApparently, Apple startes interviewing for a role prior to receiving approval and requires 4 levels of signatures up to the VP level to roll out the offer.\n\nSo, anyone waiting on Apple, just keep following up as they as gonna take their own time!\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Offer\nI already had an offer from Amazon for SDE 2, and so the baseline was set.\nApple was **NOT** able to match my Amazon offer at IC3 level as I only had 4.5 YOE and didn't qualify for IC4 :(\n\n**Base:** 175K\n**Stock:** 33K / year\n**Sign On: **20k\n**Yearly Bonus: **7.5% = ~13k\n\n##### 1st Year TC: 241K\n**Amazon TC: 280K**\nAmazon Innterview - https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/6558499/amazon-interview-expereince-l5-seattle-b-vmpa/\n\nI still chose Apple as I didn't want to move to Seattle and deal with Amazon Culture.\n\n\n---\n\n\nIt took me **4 months and 72 interviews** to land my first Offer after being laid off.\n\n\nJust when all hopes were lost is when I landed 4 back-to-back offers and finally picked Apple!\n\n\nKeep grinding people. Everything eventually works out.\nLuck is as important as the hard work we put in. So, don't be discouraged if you are not getting callbacks or interviews are not converting. Its not your fault.\n\n\nStay positive!\nHappy to answer any questions!\n",

    "content": "**Update:**\\n\\nI\\u2019m seeing a lot of comments asking about my compensation. I can\\u2019t share it on an open platform, but if you\\u2019re interested, drop your LinkedIn ID in the comments, and we can discuss it there.\\n\\n---\\n\\nHi everyone! I recently got an **L4 Software Engineer offer at Google** and wanted to share my experience. This post might help anyone preparing for Google interviews.  \\n\\n\\n## Timeline  \\n\\n- **Application**: I regularly applied on the Google Careers website and submitted another application in late October.  \\n- **Recruiter Outreach**: Mid-November. My profile was shortlisted, and the recruiter explained the process:  \\n  - **1 Screening Round** (focused on DSA)  \\n  - **4 Onsite Rounds**:  \\n    - 3 DSA interviews  \\n    - 1 General Non-Technical Leadership (GNL) round  \\n  - I was given **3 weeks** to prepare for the screening and onsites both.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n## Phone Screening  (Mid Dec)\\n\\n- **Question**: https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/6038441/Google-or-L4-or-Phonescreen\\n- **Experience**:  I initially took the wrong approach in my first follow-up, but the interviewer gave me a small hint to use my previous solution. I also made some silly coding mistakes here and there.  \\n- **Verdict**: Cleared! Recruiter informed me within a week.  \\n- **Feedback**: HR told me I need to brush up more on DSA and coding skills.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n## Onsite Interviews  (Early Jan)\\n\\n### Disclaimer  \\nDue to NDA, I cannot share the exact questions from my onsite interviews. However, I\\u2019ve included **similar LeetCode questions** that closely resemble the ones I was asked. If you can solve these, you should be well-prepared for the actual interview questions.  \\n\\n### Onsite 1: \\n- **Question:** https://leetcode.com/problems/burst-balloons/description/\\n- **Experience**: I solved the problem but missed one edge case. The interviewer kindly pointed it out. I took a lot of time dry-running my code, which left less time for follow-ups. Despite that, the interviewer asked three follow-ups, which I coded up quickly and tested.  \\n- **Verdict**: Positive  \\n- **Self-Rating**: Hire / Strong Hire  \\n\\n---\\n\\n### Onsite 2: \\n- **Question:** https://leetcode.com/problems/substring-with-concatenation-of-all-words/description/\\n- **Experience**: This was my best round. I coded the solution in under 10 minutes and handled two follow-ups by modifying the initial code. We wrapped up within 30 minutes. Unfortunately, the interviewer seemed uninterested, possibly multitasking, so I had to speak continuously to keep them engaged.  \\n- **Verdict**: Positive  \\n- **Self-Rating**: Strong Hire  \\n\\n---\\n\\n### Onsite 3: \\n- **Question:** https://leetcode.com/problems/moving-average-from-data-stream/description/ \\n- **Experience**: This was my worst round. I misunderstood the question and spent nearly 30 minutes pursuing the wrong approach. The interviewer re-explained the problem using better examples, and with some hints, I managed to code the solution in 10 minutes. I also solved one follow-up in the last 5 minutes.  \\n- **Verdict**: Positive  \\n- **Self-Rating**: Lean Hire  \\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Onsite 4: Behavioral (GNL)**  \\n- **Preparation**: I followed the **STAR method** (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to structure my answers. Practiced for two days using this [list of behavioral questions](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/5963463/Googlyness-Frequently-Asked-Questions). Fortunately, all the questions asked were ones I had prepared for.  \\n- **Verdict**: Positive  \\n- **Self-Rating**: Hire / Strong Hire  \\n\\n---\\n\\n## Final Outcome  \\n\\nAfter the interviews, the recruiter informed me that I had received **positive feedback** from all rounds. I had a team-matching call two days later and received my **offer letter** last week. \\uD83C\\uDF89  \\n\\n---\\n\\n## FAQs  \\n\\n### What was your preparation strategy?  \\n- Solved **Leetcode 150**, **Google-tagged questions** from the last 1\\u20133 months, and most Google-related questions from the past year (500+ problems in total).  \\n- Focused on graphs, trees, and segment trees, which were my weak areas\\u2014but ironically, they didn\\u2019t appear in the interviews! \\uD83D\\uDE05  \\n- Took **20+ mock interviews** to become confident in the interview format.  \\n\\n### Can you share the exact questions?  \\nNo, I can\\u2019t share them due to NDA, but I\\u2019ve linked similar ones.  \\n\\n### What was the location?  \\nBangalore, India.  \\n\\n### Were the interviewers Indian or from the US?  \\nIndian.  \\n\\n### What were the timings?  \\nBetween **12:00 PM and 4:00 PM**.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n## Key Takeaways  \\n\\n1. **Clarify the problem**: If unsure, ask questions early to avoid wasting time.  \\n2. **Stay engaged**: If your interviewer seems distracted, talk through your thought process to involve them.  \\n3. **Practice follow-ups**: Google emphasizes follow-up questions. Make sure you can adapt your initial solution.  \\n\\n---\\n\\nI hope this post helps! Best of luck to anyone preparing for Google interviews. \\uD83D\\uDE80\\n",

I am someone who comes from a Tier-1 college(IIT) but Tier-3 city :-) \\nPersonally, in my early 30s, and as a young man married and marred, and father of 2 kids, I think I have already aged and chained so heavily, being tied to the constraints I hold w.r.t family commitments, peace of mind. \\n\\nWe may all be getting 1cr+ package at 8-10yoe, but this is:\\n- largely all in BLR/Hyd. \\n- remote paymasters of this range are on the fingertips, infact. e.g Coinbase, what else really pays even 75L remotely?\\n- all these packages are barely 60% basic, maybe 5-10% bonus, 5-0% one-offs, and good 20-30% are stocks/esops\\n\\nThe culture somewhere we\\'ve brought ourselves into, vis-a-vis, people who\\'ve been simply unemployable had they been to tier-3 college in a medic/accountancy etc profession, are grinding LC and making such huge amounts- such that I feel bad for myself for having gone to an old IIT. \\nAnd further in this rat race, every finish line is the beginning of a new race. This is the life of most of us:\\n\\n1. Live in BLR/Hyd, in a place that barely absorbs you. Leaving family behind, away from your happy place.\\n> Happy lives a man, with a few paternal acres bount ... \\n2. Slog 10 hrs a day, disregarding WLB, largely to pay upto 40% taxes owing to surcharge levied on whatever 50L+ you make.\\n> all the barrens of a busy life\\n3. Don\\'t understand the difference b/w a 32-bit and 64-bit OS, but be a LC parrot or gulp-and-blab in the interviews whatever those Didi/Bhayia taught you. \\n> with everyone hunting for gold here, some sell shovels : 4-5years experienced DS/A Sys Design gurus selling and teaching you half-baked system design problems that are miles away from practicality/application.\\n\\nAll in all, coming from my tier-3 city background, the opinion to be sought is:\\n\" Could you generally advise a rule of thumb- from short term/long term P.O.V, which of the following to prefer\": \\n\\nA. 60-65Lpa mostly cash component, but remote-working.\\nB. 75-80Lpa with 60-65L cash component, but hybrid + WLB. Needing to relocate to some of the busiest cities one doesnt always see belonging to.\\nC. 1Cr, 1+Cr, delivering high octane, surviving PIPs- disregarding that father/mother, son/daughter, brother/sister, friend/social animal in you for being a money-minting machine that operates 12hrs a day, 6days a week!\\n\\nThis is an open-ended, subjective discussion, and while it is not about a specific company\\'s compensation, it is meant to stir up something in us, maybe shape the veracity/value of the compensations that the community enlists here every now-and-then, realise its impact/value holistically, and introspect where are we all heading to.\\n\\np.s: I didnt want to be rude to tier-3, but just imagine, \\n\\xA7. what is making us all running after the IT? are we digging our own graves? One day, jobs will be even scarce, and with entire Indian subcontinent running after these IT jobs, how a supply/demand stance shall exploit us hard when we\\'ve all established ourselves so deep into such profession?\\n\\xA7. to the Hiring Teams, Orgs, and \"Educators\", would you go by the \"degrees dont matter, colleges dont matter\" narrative, if you were to say, consult a doctor, consult a CA? I want jobs for everyone, but chucking such filters away are hollistically dragging even the real talent, along with someone who crams LC word-for-word, into a deep dungeon. \\n\\n",

Minimum no.of jumps needed for all the frogs to jump to the rightmost stone needed to be found. Have explained the greedy approach to favour jumping over as many frogs as possible. After a few dry runs and some discussion with the interviewer, I found out that the index of the left most frog is what we needed and this is an O(1) Solution. Interviewer was satisfied.\\nQuestion 2:\\nI was expected to explain how removing a node from binary search tree would work. I couldn\\'t come up with the `left most node of right subtree` or `right most node of left subtree`  all by myself, needed some help from the interviewer.\\n\\n**Round 2: System Design**\\nThis round was with an SDE-2, I was asked to build a rider onboarding application. First 15-20 mins went for discussing the requirements and defining the scope of the problem. Then I was asked to decide between SQL and NoSQL database. I was grilled thorughly for every decision i took. Then, discussion went into internal details of Amazon Dynamo Db, types of indexes it has and how i would define tables for this usecase and defining Partition Key & Sort Key for each table. At the end, I was asked on ways to reduce latency in Http Server, had discussions on Status Code based Retries, Long & Short Polling.\\nThis round went for 75 mins and got positive feedback from the interviewer.\\n\\n**Round 3: Culture Fit**\\nThis was more of a disclaimer thing, making sure we align with the high-paced work culture of blinkit, was given the offer in this interview itself.

When my interviews got scheduled I just went through some standard medium/Hard problems. For most of the companies doing leetcode is enough.

Always try to attempt harder questions than your current level. \\nSystem design : \\n     For LLD I have gone through online blogs and youTube but mainly I frame my answers according to my learnings till now. Ideally at 2+ years exp you are already aware of most of the basics of LLD so go through the basics of LLD and then apply your day to day Dev skills to frame the answer (please refer some standard questions online and then frame the answer that way). \\n\\t For HLD you can follow CodeKarle youTube channel, that covers all the basics of hld and he has covered all the standard questions. You can watch those and form your solutions according to that because any question can be answered using basics of hld and standard questions that are already available on youtube.\\n\\nOne more important note please give some mock interviews for algorithms and system design both and do not take hr round very lightly, please prepare for behavioural questions seriously before your hr/hm round. \\n\\nHow Did I apply : I applied thourgh referral, one of college seniors referred me in August end.\\nOther companies that I interviewed with : Zepto and got a call from Goldman for associate but my joining date was already very near by that time.

    "content": "I recently got an offer for Google, India (L3) and it's time to give back to the LC community.\r\n\r\nA little about me:\r\n- YOE: 1.8 Years\r\n- Current Org: Well known PBC(Not MAANG)\r\n\r\nI've applied to Google multiple times, but each time, my application status in the portal showed **Not Proceeding**. However, on November 28, I received an email from a recruiter expressing interest in my profile. After responding, I got a call from the recruiter, who explained the hiring process and sent me an invitation for a prep session. They also asked me to provide available time slots for the Technical Phone Screen (TPS). Initially, I requested about a month to prepare and suggested slots for the first week of January. However, the recruiter encouraged me to choose an earlier date due to the upcoming holiday season.  \r\n\r\n# TPS [17/12/2024]\r\nThe interviewer introduced himself and quickly proceeded with the question.\r\n### Question 1: \r\nThere is an array of size n. Find the sum of all possible valid subsequences in the array.\r\nValid Subsequence: Continuous subarray with absolute difference of 1 between adjacent elements.\r\nInput: [4,5,4,9,10,11,3,8]\r\nAns: 99\r\nInput: [11,35]\r\nAns: 46\r\n\r\n### Follow up: \r\nYou are in a memory constrained environment, Do not have space to load the entire array in the memory. \r\n\r\nI began by clarifying the constraints and then explained the brute force approach, followed by the optimal solution with an example. I also outlined the expected time and space complexity of the brute force and the optimal approach. The interviewer then asked me to code the optimal solution. After coding, I dry-ran the implementation using a few edge cases and the given example. The interviewer seemed satisfied, though the dry run took some time due to calculations.  \r\n\r\nWith limited time remaining, the interviewer proceeded with a follow-up question. I explained my approach, and he appeared satisfied but did not ask me to code. Towards the end, I asked a few questions about Google's work culture, and the interview concluded.  \r\n\r\nWithin two hours, I was informed that the feedback was positive, and I was asked to share my availability for onsite rounds.\r\n\r\nI shared my available time slots for the onsite interviews and took about a month to prepare.\r\n\r\n# OS1 [09/01/2025]\r\n\r\nThe interviewer briefly introduced himself and asked for a quick introduction from me. He then provided a quick overview of the process and expectations before proceeding with the questions.\r\n\r\n### Question 1:\r\nThere are piles of car parking tickets, each having the arrival time and departure time of the car. Return the number of cars in the garage at any given time. \r\n\r\n### Follow up: \r\nThe question was turned into a garage system design question, with constraints like capacity of the garage, day checks and parking fee calculation\r\n\r\n### Question 2:\r\n\r\nYou are given multiple (x,y) coordinates. For any point give the number of rectangles covering the point.\r\nSimilar Question: Count Number of Rectangles Containing Each Point - LeetCode [Difference: Rectangle didn’t have one corner in the origin]\r\n\r\nI was able to solve the first question along with its follow-up, but I struggled with the second question. I proposed an approach, but the interviewer didn’t seem fully convinced. I tried hard to refine my solution, but despite my efforts, the interviewer simply nodded without indicating much progress. Eventually, I admitted that I couldn’t come up with a better approach. The interviewer was very kind and reassured me, saying that even if I spent the next 10 minutes finding a solution, we wouldn’t have enough time to code it. He quickly presented another question, and I took a moment to regain my composure and focus, determined to give my best effort in solving it.\r\n### Question 3:\r\n\r\nThis question was related to logs of a telephone company. He asked me to create two functions, one for registering each log and one to find the most talkative person at any timestamp (whenever the function is invoked)\r\n\r\nI asked for a few clarifying questions related to the format of the logs and quickly came up and coded the optimal solution and the interviewer seemed satisfied.\r\n\r\n**Self Rating:** Lean Hire\r\n\r\n# OS2 [10/01/2025]\r\nThe interviewer introduced himself and proceeded with the questions.\r\n\r\n### Question 1:\r\nSimilar to: Minimum Area Rectangle - LeetCode [Replace Minimum with Maximum]\r\nFollow Up:\r\nThe rectangles formed are not parallel to the axis.\r\n\r\n### Question 2:\r\nThere are multiple centres which communicate with each other. There are two-way communication channels between the centres. There is a list of corrupted stations.\r\nGiven the communication channels, source and destination nodes, determine if you can reach the destination node without traversing through any of the corrupted stations.\r\n\r\nI successfully solved both questions optimally, explained my approaches along with their time complexities, and dry-ran the solutions using edge cases and a few example test cases. The interviewer seemed satisfied with my responses.  \r\n\r\nTowards the end, I asked about working at Google, the team he is part of, and the coding culture among employees. The interview concluded about 10 minutes early.\r\n\r\n**Self Rating:** Strong Hire\r\n\r\n\r\n# Reschedule:\r\n\r\nThe $3^{rd}$ coding round and the Googliness interview were originally scheduled for January 11, 2025, and January 12, 2025, respectively. However, both were rescheduled just two hours before their scheduled times due to the interviewer's unavailability.\r\n\r\n# OS3 [23/01/2025]\r\n\r\nThe interviewer quickly introduced himself and pasted the question.\r\n### Question 1:\r\nSimilar to: https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/1670250/google-phone-airplane-schedule-by-l55tco-bwer/\r\n\r\n### Follow up:\r\nCouldn't find a similar question in Leetcode. But the earlier question was modified to return all possible routes (backtracking)\r\n\r\nI successfully solved both questions optimally, but the interviewer maintained a neutral expression and remained straight-faced throughout the interview. He was highly focused on time and space complexities, questioning every data structure I chose. I wasn’t given a predefined input format for the questions, and the interviewer asked how the time complexity would change if the input were provided in a different format or if there were alternative ways to store the inputs.\r\n\r\n**Self Rating**: Hire\r\n\r\n# Googliness [24/01/2025]\r\n\r\nThe interview included general leadership and situational questions, which I answered honestly—or rather, based on what felt right to me. In the end, I asked my own questions about Google's benefits and work culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Feedback:\r\nI never recieved a detailed feedback. My recruiter mentioned the feedback is positive and my profile is being routed for team-matching, 3 hours after the Googliness round.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen began the long wait—there was no communication or team fit calls for about a month. During this time, my recruiter changed, and I received a call from my new recruiter asking if I had any experience or interest in Java. I responded affirmatively, and she mentioned that she would check with the hiring manager. The team fit call was scheduled for the very next day.\r\n\r\n# Team Fit Call [26/02/2025]\r\nThe Hiring Manager asked about my work experience and provided an overview of the role. However, my background didn’t fully align with the role’s requirements. I explained my day-to-day responsibilities in my current job and asked more about the position. He asked if I would be open to an additional discussion with another tech lead, to which I agreed.    \r\n\r\nBy the end of the conversation, he mentioned that while he found my profile intriguing, he wasn’t entirely sure about the fit due to differences in tech stacks. The discussion lasted 45 minutes and involved a back-and-forth conversation about my reasons for transitioning to a different tech stack. Before concluding, he said, “Let me gather my thoughts and think it through. I’ll update the recruiter within two days.”\r\n\r\n### The Offer:\r\n\r\n- 28/02/2025: The recruiter called me with positive feedback—the team wanted to move forward, which I didn't expect! I was asked for my confirmation on proceeding, and I responded affirmatively.\r\n- 05/03/2025: Compensation discussion.\r\n- Recieved the offer letter, the very next day!!! \r\n\r\n\r\n# Preparation:\r\nI prepared while working a full-time job but practiced extensively earlier during placements. Till date I have solved a total of 1008 Questions [Easy: 244, Med: 594, Hard: 170]. I subscribed to LeetCode Premium after receiving positive feedback in TPS and solved as many Google-tagged questions as possible, focusing more on recognizing patterns. I also thoroughly reviewed discussions in the LeetCode Discuss section.\r\n\r\nThere were many moments throughout the process when I doubted my performance and preparedness, but I never backed down. The journey is long and requires patience—stay committed and keep going!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "content": "YoE: 7\\nExperience: mid & large scale MNCs\\nDate: November, 2024\\n\\n**Round 1** (Coding)\\n\\nProblem 1\\n```\\n/* \\nDesign a custom stack structure that supports standard stack operations while efficiently tracking both the minimum and maximum elements at any given time. Implement the CustomMinMaxStack class with the following methods:\\nCustomMinMaxStack() \\u2014 Initializes the stack.\\nvoid insert(int value) \\u2014 Adds an element\\'s value to the top of the stack.\\nvoid remove() \\u2014 Deletes the element currently at the top.\\nint peek() \\u2014 Retrieves the element currently at the top without removing it.\\nint findMin() \\u2014 Fetches the smallest element in the stack.\\nint findMax() \\u2014 Fetches the largest element in the stack.\\n\\nEach method should operate with a time complexity of O(1).\\n */\\n```\\n\\nNote: Working modular code was expected by addressing all the edge cases.\\n\\n\\nProblem 2\\n`Design a java class that takes requests and sends them to an api endpoint. The class shouldn\\'t send the request to the API immediately but batch them once the number of piled requests exceeds a maximum size. One constraint here is that a request can only be held for a max certain duration and once the duration exceeds the request should be sent immediately without waiting for the next batch.`\\n\\nNote: Code was not expected. Discussion happened around approach and how thread & async operations would work here.\\n\\n\\n\\n**Round 2** (Design)\\n\\nDesign an \\'Accounts System\\' which will be integrated with multiple third party services.\\nAs I understood, this was some existing system in Twilio and interviewer wanted to gauge my approach for it.\\nFunctional Requirement\\n-Our system will act as a source of truth for any accountId with all relevant account details for an id stored within our system\\n-Third party services can make read/write requests to this system for any accountId\\n\\nNote: Requirement was fairly stratight forward. Major discussions happened around API specs, DB choices, scalability, concurrency management.\\n\\n\\n\\n**Round 3** (HM)\\nStandard behavioural HM rounds. Scenario based mostly and past experiences.\\n\\n\\n**Round 4** (Coding)\\nSimilar to\\nhttps://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-knight-moves/description/\\n\\n\\n**Thoughts**: Pretty good interview process. HR was super transparent and thoughtful. Rounds were wrapped up within a week. Cumulative feedback was taken post first couple of rounds and then processed further.\\n\\n\\n**Offer**: https://leetcode.com/discuss/compensation/6091837/Twilio-or-L3-or-Offer",

    "content": "**YOE**: 6+\\n**Current Position**: Principal Software Engineer @ Apollo 24|7\\n**Location**: Bangalore\\n**Status**: Accepted\\n\\n**HR Screening Round**\\n\\nThe HR screening round was very insightful, with basic questions regarding my background, experience, and interest in the role. It was very professional explaining very detail about the company how it grow and what are the values inside, later given a clear walkthrough on the actual interview and feedback process.\\n\\n**Interview Overview**\\nI went through a total of five technical rounds, followed by one behavioral round and a team-matching round.\\n\\n**DSA Rounds**\\nEach round consisted of two DSA questions of above-medium difficulty, similar to Leetcode-style problems. The expectation was to:\\n* Explain the approach with time and space complexity analysis\\n* Handle edge cases\\n* Write runnable code on a code-pair platform\\n\\n**Round 1:**\\n1. Modified sliding window on a circular array.(Hard)\\n2. Modified Graph problem based on finding shortest path between any two nodes.(Medium)\\n\\n**Round 2:**\\n1. String manipulation problem involving custom sorting.(Hard)\\n2. Modified Binary Search.(Medium)\\n\\n\\u2705 Feedback: Received strong hire in both rounds and proceeded to design interviews.\\n\\n**Low-Level Design (LLD)**:\\n\\nThis round started with an algorithmic problem\\u2014merging N heaps\\u2014which was then gradually modified to handle scalability for extremely large datasets. Eventually, the discussion evolved into designing a microservice to support the solution.\\n\\nOnce the approach was finalized, I was asked to define the LLD for the microservice. This round was particularly interesting as it resembled real-world problem-solving in our day-to-day work.\\n\\n**High-Level Design (HLD)**:\\nGiven that FalconX acts as a trading broker for institutional clients across multiple crypto exchanges, the problem was designed around that domain.\\n\\n**Problem Statement:**:\\nDesign a trade execution engine for cryptocurrency trading, considering:\\n\\nUsers hold crypto balances across multiple exchanges (e.g., 2 BTC on Binance, 1 BTC on OKX, etc.).Latency varies across exchanges and is dynamically updated by downstream monitoring systems. The engine must ensure seamless trading, zero glitches, and support both cross-crypto and fiat-to-crypto trading.\\nThe challenge was to respect these latency variations while providing the best user experience.\\n\\n**Hiring Manager Round**\\nThis round was a mix of experience-based discussion and another HLD question.\\n\\n**HLD Question:**\\nDesign a Top-K selling products/categories system for an e-commerce platform that handles high throughput (40K orders/second).\\n\\n**Key areas of focus:**\\n\\n* Building a low-latency architecture\\n* Identifying & solving hot partitioning issues\\n\\n**Behavioral Round**\\nThis round had thought-provoking behavioral questions, primarily focused on:\\n\\n* My career goals\\n* Why FalconX?\\n* My motivation for switching to the financial domain\\n* Final Feedback & Offer\\n* The interview process was challenging yet insightful, thoroughly evaluating every aspect of my technical expertise.\\n\\n**Final outcome:**\\n\\u2705 Cleared all technical rounds\\n\\u274C The original position I applied for was closed or not suitable because of domain expertise.\\n\\uD83D\\uDD04 My profile was forwarded to a different hiring manager\\n\\uD83D\\uDCDE Had two additional 30-minute rounds to finalize my team\\n\\uD83C\\uDFAF Given three verticals to choose from based on my preferences\\n\\uD83D\\uDCB0 Received an offer with an excellent compensation package\\n\\n",

    "content": "Current Company: Product based company\\nYOE: ~5.5\\n**LeetCode questions solved ~ 900**\\n\\nInterview at: LinkedIn\\nRole: SSE\\nProcess took 1 month overall.\\nTentative date of Interviews : Nov 2024\\nOffer - Dec 2024\\nA recruiter reached out on LinkedIn\\n\\nBefore sharing the entire process, I just wanna share a couple things. **I faced constant rejections from March this year**. Some notable ones are **Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Uber, Meta, Stripe, Atlassian**. I had zero hopes of getting an offer from LinkedIn especially I put too much efforts but didn\\'t get the desired result. At certain times in a few companies, I felt I would receive the offer but didn\\'t. I realised I wasn\\'t handling rejections in the right way and almost took a month break from interviews and went for a small vacation. That vacation was important and I came with a fresh mind. I almost had given up and didn\\'t take anything too seriously and continued to just put efforts without worrying about the outcome but **luck played a role in getting me an offer** and making sure I was rewarded before the year end. I went to the LinkedIn interviews with a relaxed mindset without expecting much in return.\\n\\n**Some of my previous experiences**\\n\\n1. https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-experience/5173205/microsoft-azure-networking-awaiting-feedback/2429947\\n2. https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-experience/5076847/amazon-sde-2-bangalore-another-failed-attempt/2370189\\n\\n**Now here is my interview process**\\n\\n**Round 1 - Technical Phone Screen**\\n\\nMaximum Subarray Sum \\u2013 Kadane\\u2019s Algorithm - No modifications, exactly the same question\\nA tree based DS question which I don\\'t recall now.\\nVerdict - Strong hire\\n\\n**[Onsites]**\\n\\n**Round1 - DSA**\\n1. Similar to this - https://leetcode.com/problems/k-closest-points-to-origin/description/\\n2. A hard question on an array which I don\\'t recall now.\\nI couldn\\'t solve the 2nd question, just discussed the approach.\\n\\n**Round2 - DSA**\\nI struggled the most in this round, faced two hard questions. The interviewer was nice and extended the time by 15 minutes as well.\\n\\n1. Ditto - https://leetcode.com/problems/sliding-window-maximum/description/ - Was somehow able to implement it.\\n2. Top k elements after multiplying array1 values with array 2 - This question was challenging, please guys let me know your approach here. I could only discuss my approach and the time ran out.\\nExample - **arr1 = [1, 2, 5, 9] , arr2 = [1, 3, 4, 6]**\\nThe brute force solution is trivial, multiply both the arrays and return top k elements but this is not what the interviewer was expecting. I could somehow navigate through this round.\\n\\n**Round 3 - Host Leader**\\nA typical hiring manager round. This round went well.\\n\\n**Round 4- Technical Communication**\\nIn this round, I was asked to explain the most challenging project that I had worked with. This round went pretty welll too.\\n\\n**Round 5 - System Design**\\nDesign Top K system where I was asked to build a system that would gather exceptions from different services and show the top K exceptions over a 24 hour time window. I gave different approaches, discussed about data pipelines. This round went pretty good too.\\n\\n\\n**Verdict - Selected**\\nWill Update the compensation details soon.\\n\\nI hope this experience helps people. If there\\u2019s one thing I\\u2019ve learned through this journey, it\\u2019s that persistence is underrated. To all those people who are facing constant rejections, please remember you would be rewarded at the right time but please just keep putting efforts. Also, luck is equally important. **For some people this might not be a big deal but for me it wasn\\'t easy and definitely worth the hard work**.",

    "content": "My background: Total 2 years 3 months experience\\nGot a referral for an Associate role. Received hackerrank test link a week later. \\n#### Round 1 - OA\\nDon\\u2019t remember the questions but one was an easy level question and second was leetcode medium level. Was able to solve both of them. \\nThe recruiter reached me and informed me that I would be considered for an Analyst profile as my years of experience are less than 3. \\n#### Round 2 - Coderpad (13th Sep 2024)\\n**Question 1**\\nhttps://leetcode.com/problems/fraction-to-recurring-decimal/description/ \\n\\n**Question 2**\\nhttps://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/description/\\n\\nI explained the approach for the first problem and jumped into implementing it. For the second question, I discussed the extra space approach first and then explained the constant space approach and implemented it. I had to execute my code for some test cases. After that the interviewer added some more test cases. I had to handle some corner cases in the first problem in order to pass them. \\n#### Superday (18th Sep 2024)\\n#### Round 1 - Data Structures\\nTwo interviewers were present, one question asked by each of them. \\n**Question 1**\\nhttps://leetcode.com/problems/pairs-of-songs-with-total-durations-divisible-by-60/description/\\n\\n**Question 2**\\nhttps://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/description/ \\n\\nAgain the expectation here was to produce an optimized working solution that should pass the test cases. For the second question, I first gave the approach using extra space but surprisingly the interviewer asked me to code and execute that. And after executing all the test cases, he asked me to optimize the approach. I was able to explain to him the optimized approach and was able to write the code, but some tests were failing and we ran out of time. \\n#### Round 2 - Software Engineering Practices\\nTwo interviewers were present. The first interviewer asked this question. \\n**Question 1**\\nhttps://leetcode.com/problems/sliding-window-maximum/description/ \\n\\nThe remaining 30 mins were dedicated to some discussion around my resume, operating system and system design concepts. \\nThe interviewer went in depth in one of my recent projects in my current company. \\nAfter that he started asking OS questions like:\\n* Difference between process and a thread\\n* Deadlocks\\n* What is semaphore and how it is used in OS\\n\\nThe interviewer then asked how to handle concurrency in a theater booking system, focusing on how to make sure two users don\\u2019t book the same seat at the same time. I was also asked about handling cases where payment doesn\\'t go through and how to release the seat if the user doesn\\u2019t complete the payment. The interviewer asked about what would be the best customer experience during the entire process. Additionally, the interviewer wanted to know how to identify and prevent payment failures before the user even goes to the payment page. We discussed using locking methods, setting time limits for holding seats, checking seat availability in real-time, and doing checks before sending users to the payment page.\\n#### Round 3 - Software Design and Architecture\\n**Question 1**\\nGiven a 2-D String array of student-marks, find the student with the highest average and output his average score. If the average is in decimals, floor it down to the nearest integer.\\n```\\nInput:  [{\"Bob\",\"87\"}, {\"Mike\", \"35\"},{\"Bob\", \"52\"}, {\"Jason\",\"35\"}, {\"Mike\", \"55\"}, {\"Jessica\", \"99\"}] Output: 99 \\nExplanation: Since Jessica\\'s average is greater than Bob\\'s, Mike\\'s and Jason\\'s average.\\n```\\n\\nI explained the brute force as well as the optimized approach. Then was expected to code and execute the sample test cases. The interviewer then added some additional test cases for these. Some tests were failing due to negative scores. Fixed the cases. \\n\\nThe second interviewer asked me some Java related questions like:\\n* Comparator and Comparable \\n* Serialization and Deserialization in Java\\n* Exception handling related questions\\n\\nI was asked how to design a system where employee records are sent from an upstream service to my service, which then updates the data in a downstream service. Handling the communication between services (Kafka / SNS-SQS (I had experience with SNS-SQS)). The same employee record with a different timestamp can arrive, we have to update the previous record based on timestamp. This timestamp is different from the current timestamp. (Records can come in any order of timestamps). \\nI clarified the requirements but felt that the time left was too low. Proposed the approach to the interviewer, he then asked me about the database choices (SQL / NOSQL) and was asked to write a schema for the employee record. \\n#### Round 4 - Hiring Manager\\nIt was a quick 20-25 mins call. The HM asked some questions like \\n* Why I am leaving the current company\\n* Why GS\\n* Asked me to explain one of my recent projects in my current company, asked few questions on that\\n* My expectations from GS and the role\\n* My views on work from office culture\\nI asked him the team charter and goals for the next couple of years. \\n\\n**Verdict**: Received offer 2 weeks later. \\n\\n**Compensation Details**: https://leetcode.com/discuss/compensation/5921924/goldman-sachs-vs-flipkart-bengaluru/2678378\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",
